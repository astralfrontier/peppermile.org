_Past the stone walls that divide your village from the fairy forest,
there's a glow coming from that old cave..._

_In the attic of your family's cottage,
there is a rusty sword that begins to sing one night..._

_This morning your mother woke you up,
and you find yourself meeting the strange girl with a mysterious pendant..._

Every map has blanks.
Every story has gaps.
Every old ruin has secrets.
And every person has a dream: to experience those mysteries.
To chart a course into the unknown. To explore. To adventure.

Grand Adventure is a roleplaying game,
telling stories about **how adventurers work together to
discover amazing new things, solve challenges, and explore a fantastic world**.
