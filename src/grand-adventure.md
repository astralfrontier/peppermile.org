<button class="toggle-directors-cut">Director's Cut</button>

_Past the stone walls that divide your village from the fairy forest,
there's a glow coming from that old cave..._

_In the attic of your family's cottage,
there is a rusty sword that begins to sing one night..._

_This morning your mother woke you up,
and you find yourself meeting the strange girl with a mysterious pendant..._

Every map has blanks.
Every story has gaps.
Every old ruin has secrets.
And every person has a dream: to experience those mysteries.
To chart a course into the unknown. To explore. To adventure.

Grand Adventure is a roleplaying game,
telling stories about **how adventurers work together to
discover amazing new things, solve challenges, and explore a fantastic world**.

Throughout this document, you'll find sections of text like this.
These explain my motivations and thoughts about a particular rule.

## How to Play

You need several people to be players, at least two but not more than five or so.
One person will take the "MC" role (described below).
The others will have individual player characters, or "PCs".
Everyone who plays will need several six-sided dice (d6),
and paper and pencils for note-taking.

### How to be a player

As a player, you **narrate the actions of your player character**,
as they adventure in a fictional world you and your friends create together.
You say the things your character would say,
describe the things your character would do.

**Fictional license** is permission to narrate something about the game world.
Most characters can walk, pick up objects, and speak,
so you can freely describe your character doing these things.
A character with a sword can use it to block attacks or cut things,
but probably can't make an energy beam come out of the blade
(unless the sword is magical)
or turn it into a stack of gold (unless it's really magical).

Players have fictional license over their own characters,
and over whatever parts of the game world the MC permits,
but do not have license to narrate for other players' characters without their permission.

Fictional license has some overlap with some peoples' definition of
"player agency": how much you're allowed to say, and how much of it
will be treated as "real" by the other players.
Like "canon" in TV or movie franchises, this can sometimes be hard to pin down.
{.directors-cut}

### How to be the MC

"MC" stands for "Master of Ceremonies".
In this game, stories are created together by the group,
with contributions from the game rules.
The MC's role is to help weave these stories into a coherent whole and propel them along.
The MC can tell stories too, just like any other player,
but the MC's special role is to **set a consistent tone for the stories the players tell**.
Like the conductor of an orchestra,
the MC's job is not to make the music,
but to keep everyone else's performance in harmony.

In order to do their job, the MC doesn't have their own PC,
but does have fictional license to speak for every part of the game world.
In addition, while the group should collectively agree on what's possible
for a given character,
the MC has final authority over fictional license for other players.
The MC should be permissive in allowing players to drive story forward,
and only intervene to maintain the tone.

What is the "tone"? It's the **feelings you want to get from the story**
and the **expectations you have for the story**.
In a game driven by optimism and hope, you generally expect happy endings,
minimal bloody violence, and consistent loyalties.
In darker games, betrayals of trust, tragic deaths, and moral dilemmas are the norm.
You have several tools for setting the tone.
You can use word choices, like "killed" vs. "defeated", or narrative choices,
like "the enemies surrender" vs. "the enemies fight to the death".
The group should discuss the specific tone they want for their game,
but the MC has the authority to enforce it during the game.

### How to use these rules

The game itself is just a set of rules.
You use these rules to **spark, frame, and support a conversation about the fiction**.
So what does that mean?

**The fiction** is the name for the world of wonder, mystery,
and excitement that you all are imagining and describing together,
and for the events that take place in that world.
When you say "there's a lumbering Ogre with a stout wooden club,
and it takes a swing at Tana's head", that's the fiction.

**The conversation** about that fiction is what you, the players,
say to each other about the world, your characters, and what is or should be going on.
When you say "I think the Ogre should have a spear instead of a club",
or when the MC asks the players, "what is Tana doing about the Ogre?",
that is part of the conversation.

**The rules give you a vocabulary for having this conversation**.
When you see rules for Pools, Actions, Challenges, or Discoveries, for example,
these are tools for the MC and the other players to give a structure to what's happening.
Is the Ogre particularly tough or wimpy?
Its Action Cost will determine how easily you can attack it.
How long will the Ogre last in a fight before it's defeated?
Giving it a Pool lets you track damage done to it,
until it is hurt badly enough to run away.

The rules will help you take players from one Discovery to another,
facing Challenges along the way.
Each Challenge is dealt with by characters performing Actions.
A character's Actions are formed from the Words they have access to.
Performing Actions will deplete the characters' Pools,
which are eventually recharged at the next Discovery.

Use the rules when the group doesn't already know the answer to a question posed by the story,
such as "can we defeat the Ogre?"
If the MC narrates the presence of an Ogre and frames it as a Challenge,
the players are being asked to use the rules for Challenges to deal with it.
But the rules are tools for moving the game forward,
not a straitjacket preventing the players from creating a shared story.
If just swatting the Ogre aside is more appropriate to maintain the feel of the game,
then narrating that action is sufficient.

### Words and Intent

A rule of the game is that
**players should honor the intent of their fellow players' words**.
Here's some examples of this principle in action.

If a player tells the MC that her character has a Word called "Befriend",
that clearly signals the sort of actions she wants her PC to take.
The MC shouldn't interpret that as "Intimidate" or "Provoke".
Likewise, if the MC says that a creature is "forbidding" or "dangerous",
only truly heroic action can justify using an action like "Befriend" to overcome that creature.

If the MC tells you that your character steps into a "mysterious temple",
what do you imagine?
Perhaps soft lighting coming through a stained glass window,
coming from an unknown source.
Shelves feature books written in an old language.
On the wall are inscribed holy symbols belonging to ancient gods.
Gently glowing crystal orbs hanging on the walls.

But say that instead, the MC tells you that it's an "eldritch fane".
A fane is a temple, and "eldritch" can mean "mysterious",
but the whole feeling is different.
Perhaps now there's an altar in your imagination, stained with
something's - or someone's - blood.
The walls are darker.
Jagged runes spell out dark portents.
The PCs should not feel as comfortable in such a place,
because the MC is signaling danger and menace.

Honoring words is central to the rest of the game, from archetypes
to advancement. "I get to say a certain type of thing happens"
is pretty powerful, if the MC is interpreting your success in light
of the words you use.
If you say "I befriend the creature" and the dice agree,
but the MC says "oh well, it doesn't happen",
that can feel pretty crappy.
{.directors-cut}

## Quick Character Creation

Pick a **name** for your character.

Pick two **adjectives** that describe your character:
Brave, Clever, Cool, Curious, Determined, or Mysterious.
Write them down, followed by "Adventurer", as your first **Archetype**.
For example, "Brave Cool Adventurer".
You'll gain other Archetypes, like "Ninja", "Knight", or "Werewolf", as you play the game.

Words are how you describe your actions in the game.
You'll gain more Words, or create your own,
as you play and discover the sort of adventurer you want to be.

Write down the **Words** you start with, based on which adjectives you picked:

* Confront (if you picked Brave, Cool, or Mysterious)
* Resist (if you picked Brave, Curious, or Determined)
* Avoid (if you picked Clever, Determined, or Mysterious)
* Outwit (if you picked Clever, Cool, or Curious)

Write a **star** (&#9734;) next to each Word you start with.
If you picked two adjectives that give you the same Word,
write two stars (&#9734;&#9734;).
More stars mean you are more experienced using that Word.

Write down a **Pool**: "Resolve (&#9825;&#9825;)".

Pools are your ability to keep doing what you do.
They measure your health, fatigue, sneakiness, magical power, and many other things.
When you use your Words, their cost is paid for by rolling dice from your Pools.
Your "Resolve" Pool comes with being an adventurer,
and is your grit in the face of adversity.

Think up a concept or a pitch for the first story you want to tell about your character,
and write it down under **Threads**.
For example, "Searching for an ancient family sword".
You don't have to know how this story will end, only how it will start.

Finally, think about some visual **flair**.
Flair is some trait, accessory, or habit that embodies one of your adjectives
or suggests the Thread you'll be chasing.
A wooden sword, a special pendant, a thick book, goggles, an unusual hair color,
heterochromatic eyes, and many other things can be flair.

Now you're ready to adventure!

## Pools

A Pool is how you track something you lose or regain often,
like willpower, stamina, stealth, wealth, or magical power.
Pools have a name, like "Resolve", "Mana", or "Rage".

**A Pool holds dice**.
Each Pool has some number of six-sided dice (d6) in it.

**Pools have a current and maximum size**.
The current size is how many dice are in the Pool at the moment.
The maximum size is how many dice can ever be in the Pool at a time.
The Pool's maximum size is measured in **hearts** (&#9825;).

**Pools can have dice Taken from them or Given to them**.
Any dice Taken from a Pool are not automatically returned.
Only Give dice to a pool when a rule tells you to do so.

**Pools can be Recharged**.
If a rule tells you to recharge a Pool, Give it dice up to its maximum size.

**A Pool can be Lent to someone or something**.
Your target receives a Pool temporarily.
If the rule that lends the Pool doesn't specify how many dice it has,
Give it one.
If the rule doesn't specify a current size for the Pool, it starts at its maximum size.
A lent Pool is removed from the target's character sheet when its current size reaches zero.
If you lend someone a Pool they already have,
you can give it dice instead, up to its maximum.
If you lend someone a Pool you have as well, you don't lose it.

**A Pool can be Leveled Up**.
Add one die to the Pool's maximum size, permanently, and Recharge the Pool.
You cannot Level Up a Pool that's been lent to you.

Pools are intentionally limited to five dice.
This supports a larger design goal, which is to get players
to use different tactical approaches within a challenge.
Pools can function a little like aspects with free invokes from Fate,
in that you can use them to enhance your chances of success.
{.directors-cut}

**Pools can have optional rules**.
For example, the Resolve Pool will Recharge whenever you reach a new Discovery,
while the Stealth Pool might Recharge only when you are sneaking around.

**Pools with the same name are the same Pool**.
If your Wizard has an "MP" Pool for magical power,
and you also become a Cleric that also has an "MP" Pool,
you have one MP Pool, not two.

## Words

A Word is a verb, noun, adjective, or phrase with special significance in the game.
Words tell your group about the actions you are performing,
and optionally give you special rules for performing those actions.

Words are intended to take the basic power of PbtA moves -
characterizing a PC by describing what they can do -
at a much finer resolution.
Instead of a move that comes prebaked and complete, you can synthesize
new moves by assembling Words.
{.directors-cut}

A Word can contain multiple English words.
"Giant Lizard" is a Word in the game-mechanical sense.

**Words signal intention**.
"Confront" and "Avoid" mean different things in the fiction,
even if they use the same rules.
"Defeat" is not the same as "Kill", or "Assassinate".
Listen to what the Word tells you, and honor what it means.
Words can come with a description that explain their meaning more clearly.

Words doing what they say should be the whole driving force
behind taking new words during advancement.
If you "Confront" a monster, the MC has a lot of leeway to interpret that.
But if you "Befriend" one, that's giving you a lot more authority over the world.
You earn that authority through advancement.
{.directors-cut}

**Words can have optional rules**.
For example, a Word might say "The Stealth Pool may be used"
or "Lend a friendly target a Magic Shield Pool".

**Words have an activation cost**.
To include the Word in an action,
you must allocate dice to the Word that sum to the cost or higher.
For example, a Word with cost 4 can be activated with a roll of 4 or higher,
or two dice showing 1 and 3, and so on.

**Words can optionally have a Star rating**.
Write a Word's activation cost as "cost stars", e.g. 2 &#9734;&#9734;.
Words cannot have more than five stars.
Stars allow the player to recover dice from their action - one die per star.

**A Word can be Leveled Up**.
Add one star (&#9734;) to the Word, permanently.
No Word can be Leveled Up to more than five stars.
Words without a star rating cannot be Leveled Up.

**The same name with the same rules always refers to the same Word**.
For example, the Fighter and Knight might both have an "Attack" Word.
If a Fighter also became a Knight, she only has one "Attack" Word, not two.
You should try never to use the same Word but different rules.
Instead, pick a new Word.

### Setting Word costs

Most action Words will have a cost of 4.
Most modifier Words will have a cost of 1.
Challenge Words are set by the difficulty of the Challenge.

The MC may adjust Word costs in play.
A powerful Word might cost 1 or 2 more points than normal.

## Archetypes

An Archetype is a collection of traits that describe a sort of character,
like Fighter, Magic User, Elf, or Werewolf.
Characters can have multiple Archetypes.
For example, a character can be an Elf/Magic User/Fighter.

A character doesn't have to have an Archetype to describe themselves as something.
For example, a player can say "my character is an Elf"
without starting with the Elf Archetype.
It's only when they want to put a spotlight on their Elf-ness that
the Archetype becomes important.

**Archetypes come with a set of Pools and Words**.
A typical Archetype should have one or two Words and one or two Pools
that work together to support the Archetype's theme.
For example, a Fighter might have "Attack" and "Bravely" Words,
and a "Courage" Pool.
When you gain that Archetype, you gain those Words and Pools.

**Archetypes can share Words and Pools**.
If you gain a new Archetype that has a Word or Pool you already have,
you should Level Up the Word or Pool instead of taking it a second time.
For example, a Fighter with the "Attack" Word who becomes a Knight
will Level Up his Attack, rather than gaining it a second time.

Archetypes are the bridge between traditional race/class/job
mechanics and the more freeform story-game style thing
where you just write a description of you who are.
{.directors-cut}

## Challenges

A Challenge is anything in the fiction that confronts the characters
and forces them to resolve it before they can continue.
An encounter with wandering monsters, an avalanche blocking the valley,
and an out-of-control magic spell can all be Challenges.

Challenges must be _interesting_ and _difficult_ but not _impossible_.
A hidden elf village with homes growing organically out of the trunks of
giant trees can be interesting, but doesn't pose any difficulty by itself.
But if the elves living there are hostile to the PCs,
and must be won over somehow, that is a Challenge.
Similarly, trekking through an endless desert can be difficult,
but probably isn't interesting - the players would probably rather not roll
to forage for water daily, for example.
If there's an Ancient Red Dragon and it's impossible to beat it somehow,
it's unfair to present it as a Challenge.
The MC should simply narrate its actions, such as setting fire to a village.

**Challenges are situations, not creatures**.
The Challenge is not "the red dragon",
and the Challenge doesn't necessarily end if the Dragon itself dies.
Similarly, the Challenge might be resolved by successfully hiding from
or sneaking past the Dragon, rather than fighting or killing it.

This is especially important if you have a PC who can disable,
kill, or banish a given opponent. The challenge isn't short-circuited
if that happens early. Rather, the problem should be reframed.
{.directors-cut}

**Challenges have a difficulty rating**.
Typical difficulty ratings are between 1 (the simplest monsters, like Slimes,
that novice adventurers can beat)
and 20 (giant or powerful monsters such as ancient dragons, kraken, and the like).

PbtA games don't have a difficulty scale as such,
you just have to do more rolls to accomplish harder tasks.
Understanding this balance seems to be difficult for some
novice PbtA MCs. In this game, both difficulty and time scale
for a challenge are spelled out in advance.
{.directors-cut}

**Challenges have an endurance**.
This is measured in squares (&#x25A1;), usually two or more.
As a general rule, the more PCs you have,
the more squares of endurance your Challenges should have,
so that everybody has a chance to act against them.

Depleting squares isn't just a matter of wearing down a monster's hit points.
Rather, it represents the different stages of confronting a Challenge.
For example, the party might fight a dragon!
It might have one or more squares representing the following stages:

1. The dragon starts on the ground, using its claws and tail to attack.
2. The dragon takes to the air and attacks at range.
3. The dragon breathes fire on the nearby village.
4. The dragon flies faster and must be forced down.
5. The dragon is desperate and fights with everything.

Every successful Action against a Challenge checks off one of its squares.
When a Challenge has no squares left, it's resolved.
Characters can pay the activation cost for a Challenge multiple times,
depleting one extra squares, as part of the same action.

For example, Tana is fighting Slimes.
They're easy to beat (difficulty 2) but have 5 squares.
Tana rolls 3 dice, getting 2, 3, and 5.
She assigns all these dice to the Slime Word,
and checks off 3 of the Challenge's squares.

Each squares of endurance might have a different difficulty rating.
For example, a situation that gets progressively more difficult might have
an endurance like this: 10 &#x25A1;&#x25A1;, 15 &#x25A1;&#x25A1;, 20 &#x25A1;.
Clearing the first two squares each has a difficulty of 10,
the next two has 15, and the final one has 20.

**Challenges are also Words**.
Their activation cost is their difficulty rating when used in an Action.

**Challenges can come with their own Twists**.
For example, a dragon can have Twists like "fiery breath!",
or a slime can divide when struck,
creating multiple smaller slimes.
Even if a Challenge specifies some Twists, the MC isn't required to use them.

**Challenges can have Features**.
Features are Words that sometimes come into play,
depending on how the characters approach the Challenge,
or what a Challenge does in response to their actions.
The MC determines the activation cost of a feature,
and whether or not it's important to include in a particular action.

For example, a Swordfighter can attack a Red Dragon (difficulty 10)
while it's crouched in its lair with an action like "Attack Red Dragon".
But out in the open, the beast might spread its wings and take to the air,
adding a "Flying" feature (cost 10).
The Swordfighter must now "Attack Flying Red Dragon", using both Words.
On the other hand, her comrade the Elven Archer can "Shoot Red Dragon"
without including the feature,
because his arrows can strike even a flying Dragon.

The MC can rule that character actions or Twists can bring features into or out of play.
For example, the Elven Archer might declare "I'm shooting at the dragon's wings
to try and ground it",
allowing the Swordfighter to renew her attack once the Dragon crashes to the ground.

Features are how you plug narrative logic into the mechanics.
If some roll would logically be harder for one PC than another,
then a feature is the appropriate way to model that.
If you think a challenge should be easy if the PCs do everything right
but hard otherwise, it should have a low difficulty and a lot of features.
{.directors-cut}

## Actions

Actions are how you resolve Challenges.
You take an action by declaring you're going to do something.
Then you choose a set of Words to model that description.
Finally, you roll dice to determine how successful you were.

For example, Tana encounters an Ogre who is attacking a helpless village.
Tana's player might say "I draw my sword and charge right for the Ogre,
yelling at it to get its attention!"

**You build Actions out of Words**.
Based on your narration, you decide which Words you have that meet that description.
The Words you pick should tell you _what you're doing_, _to whom or to what_,
and optionally _how_.

For example, Tana is a magic knight.
She has an "Attack" Word, which represents physical attacks against opponents.
She has a "With Magic" Word, which represents her ability to cast spells.
While fighting the Ogre, it becomes a Word too.
She puts the Words together: "Attack", "Ogre", "With Magic".
The result is her Action: "I'm Attacking this Ogre With Magic".

**The MC can require or forbid Words**.
The MC can decide that a Challenge's features are active for you.
For example, a dragon might have a "Flying" feature that adds a cost to melee combat.
In that case, you would have to make an Action like "Attack Flying Dragon".
The MC might also declare that you can't use certain Words.
You can't "Befriend" an avalanche or "Attack" a spell of mind control.

**Actions are summaries**.
An Action isn't a single sword swing or a single attempt to pick a lock.
An Action can be several seconds or even minutes long.
It's a series of sword thrusts, parries, and ripostes.
It's tense seconds running from a cave-in.
It's the conversation you have with the sympathetic judge.
Most of the Action will be you narrating what you do, and the MC responding.

**You cannot repeat the same Action in a Challenge.**
Once you have used a specific combination of Words, you can't re-use that combination.
You must change at least one Word.
This includes any Words the MC requires, such as features.

While facing an Ogre, Tana uses the "Attack Ogre" Action.
After that, she can't "Attack Ogre" again.
She could "Attack Ogre With Magic".
She could also "Attack Angry Ogre", if "Angry" was a feature that the MC added.
She could "Avoid" or "Outwit" the Ogre, by changing battle tactics.

This will probably be the most contentious rule in actions.
People like to do their best move over and over.
But conflicts in fiction rarely seem to work that way.
"We do this! Oh well, that didn't work, let's try this!"
feels closer to how fiction works, and thus how the game should work.
The no-repeat rule will hopefully drive players toward
teamwork moves, new archetypes rather than endlessly leveling
existing Words, and trying out different tactics.
{.directors-cut}

**You activate Words by rolling dice.**
You can roll dice from one or more Pools.
You can use a Pool if the Pool, or the Words you use, allow it.
For example, you can use the "Resolve" Pool for all actions.
Tana's "Attack" Word allows her to use her "Bravery" Pool.

When you roll dice, assign each one to a specific Word.
If you assign several dice to the same Word, add their values together.
For example, Tana's "Attack" Word has a cost of 4,
and "Ogre" has a cost of 5.
Tana has 4 Resolve dice and 2 Courage dice.
She takes both Courage dice and rolls them, getting a 4 and a 6.
She assigns the 4 to Attack and the 6 to Ogre.
The Action is now paid for.

You can choose to roll more dice at any time during the Action,
if the dice you already rolled aren't enough.
Once you roll dice, you cannot unroll them.

**You must activate every Word for your Action to succeed.**
Whether you succeed or fail, the MC determines what happens next.
The MC should respect your choice of Words.
For example, if you declare that you want to "Befriend" the Ogre,
the outcome should be peaceful.
This doesn't stop other players from taking Actions
that negate yours.

If your Action fails, you get all your rolled dice back.
You can't repeat Actions even if they failed.

**Once the action is resolved, you get dice back**.
Count up the total number of stars on all Words in the Action.
You can take back up to that many dice, but no more.
You can place the dice you get back into any Pool you want.
You cannot put more dice into a Pool than its maximum size.

For example, Tana's "Attack" word has one star (&#9734;).
When she rolls her two dice earlier, she can take one back.
She places it back into her Courage Pool.
She could have placed it into her Resolve Pool, if it wasn't full.

**The MC can offer you one or more Twists**.
If you are unable or unwilling to pay dice from your own Pools,
you can accept dice from a Twist Pool created by the MC.

**Characters can cooperate as part of a single Action.**
If several characters cooperate, they can all add Words to the Action,
and they can all contribute dice to activating those Words.
If you get dice back because some of the Words have star ratings,
the total dice returned are divided up by the players as they see fit.
No Word can be part of the same Action more than once -
for example, two characters cannot both add "Confront" to the table at the same time.

### Action Example

For example, Tana and Basler cooperate to attack a dangerous Dire Sloth.
The spunky swordswoman charges the beast with a loud war-cry,
and the sneaky thief stabs it from ambush while it's distracted!
Tana contributes "Attack" (4 &#9734;) and Basler contributes "Backstab" (4 &#9734;).
The Dire Sloth has an activation cost of 10 and must only be hit once.
The Action is "Attack and Backstab Dire Sloth".

Tana's Attack Word lets her roll Courage,
and Basler's Backstab Word lets him roll Stealth.
Tana rolls Courage dice and gets a 1 and a 4.
Basler rolls his 2 Stealth dice and gets 6 and 3.
This isn't quite enough, so Tana rolls a Resolve die and gets another 4.
They assign the dice thus: Attack (4), Backstab (4), Dire Sloth (6+3+1).
This is enough to overcome the Sloth.

There are two stars in play, one on Attack and one on Backstab.
The players each receive one die back.
Tana assigns hers back to her Resolve Pool,
while Basler takes one back for his Stealth Pool.

Challenges lose endurance per Action, not per character.
Thus, the Sloth would have lost one square, not two.

## Twists

Twists are a tool for the MC to create tension and maintain the tone of the game.
Twists can also be used to reward players for interesting or inventive tactics.

**Twist is a temporary Pool created by the MC**.
It will have between 1 and 5 dice.

**Twists come with a condition**.
If a player takes Twist dice as part of their action, the condition comes to pass.
The more dice in the Pool, the more serious or dramatic the condition should be.
Twists can represent critical hits, enemy reinforcements,
complications to an existing challenge, or many other things.
A Twist can change which features of a Challenge are active.

**Twist conditions don't have to be negative**.
The condition can also be the player agreeing to do something exciting
or interesting as part of their action,
and the Twist's dice are a reward for making the game more fun as a result.

**Twists are optional**.
Players are never forced to accept a Twist.
Players can suggest a Twist to the MC, but the MC is not required to accept.

**Multiple Twists can be in play**.
The MC might offer a one-die Twist with a minor condition,
as well as a four-dice Twist with a serious condition attached.
Players can accept both Twists, neither, or just one.

Twists are the "hero point" or "aspect" part of the game,
in that they let you save your butt without spending one of
your own personal resources.
Twists shouldn't usually come with mechanical consequences,
except perhaps enabling Features or increasing Challenge endurance.
They're a mechanical reward for accepting a change of narrative direction.
{.directors-cut}

### Example Twists

Tana is fighting a dragon! The MC offers her a Twist:
"the beast takes to the air as you come into melee range -
but you can grab hold and be carried off".
If Tana's player accepts the extra dice for her attack, that is what happens.

Sir Emory is defending his friends from bandit arrows using his trusty shield.
The MC offers a twist: "you take an arrow in the leg,
hobbling your movement, but your friends are unharmed".

Basler is trying to help his friends escape, but he's spotted sneaking up on them.
In desperation, he says "I throw two knives at the ropes keeping them tied,
leaving me unarmed."
The MC agrees this is an interesting development, and offers Twist dice.

## Advancement

Characters grow and change as part of their experiences.
When a character's Thread reaches its last milestone, you get to advance.
Pick one of the following:

* Gain a new Archetype
* Gain a new Word and/or a new Pool of your own creation
* Level Up two Words, two Pools, or a Word and a Pool

You should pick a choice that reflects what happened to the character during their story.
For example, you could choose the Mage archetype after deciphering a book of magic.
You can choose any advancement option you wish.

The MC should present the group with a list of existing Archetypes.
Players can propose new Archetypes.
The MC has the final word on any new Archetypes.
New Archetypes should support the tone of the game world.

If you take a new Archetype that has Words or Pools you already have,
Level Up those Words or Pools.
Don't take them a second time.
For example, a character already has an "MP" Pool because they are a Mage.
They choose to gain Illusionist, which also has an "MP" Pool.
They would Level Up their MP Pool, rather than take it twice.

If your idea doesn't feel like an Archetype, create a new unique Word or Pool.
For example, you want a Word like "Crystal Sword" to represent a unique magic weapon.
"Crystal Sword Wielder" doesn't sound like an Archetype.
Instead, you take it as its own Word.

For example, Sir Emory Hawthorne has unexplored feelings for his adventuring companion Tana.
His player creates an "Admiration" Pool.
He adds two special rules to it.
it Recharges whenever the two do something that deepens or acknowledges their relationship.
He can also spend dice from the Pool whenever Tana is at risk.
Later, he intercepts a goblin's attack aimed at her and succeeds thanks to the extra dice.

## Discoveries

A Discovery is some unique encounter in the fiction - a place,
an artifact of power, a strange magical phenomenon, or even a living creature.
A Discovery is always special. It might feel different from its surroundings,
but it is never out of place. It's the reason for your journey.

A Discovery will do one or more of the following things:

* Drive a story forward by presenting a question or posing a challenge
* Decisively resolve elements of a story already in motion
* Evoke strong feelings, such as wonder, fear, or joy

Every Discovery should logically suggest a few **Challenges** that go with it.
For example, a group of characters might need to deal with a pack of sharks
to reach a sunken treasure ship,
then survive a fierce storm and a pirate attack getting the treasure back to port.

### Creating Discoveries

The results you get from this process aren't the final version of a Discovery.
They are the start of a conversation about what the group wants to add to their game world.
The random generation rules are meant to start a conversation, not shut one down.


You need to answer the first and most important question about a Discovery:
_What feeling should the characters have about this?_

Second: _What is the nature of the discovery?_

Third, and optionally: _What should the characters want to do about this discovery?_

| Roll | Feeling  | Nature             | Objective                             |
| :--- | :------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Joy      | Place (normal)     | Reach the discovery                   |
| 2    | Surprise | Place (exotic)     | Get away from the discovery           |
| 3    | Anger    | Object (mundane)   | Search for something or someone       |
| 4    | Fear     | Object (exotic)    | Hide, elude, or conceal something     |
| 5    | Disgust  | Person or Creature | Strengthen, improve, or fix something |
| 6    | Sorrow   | Event              | Weaken, break, or sabotage something  |

You can answer these questions yourself, or roll 1d6 per question and look at the table.

A randomly rolled Discovery may sound interesting,
but not be suitable for the current adventure.
In that case, the MC can file it away for later use, or a player can use it as part of their own Thread down the road.

There's a fourth question that only you can answer: _Now how do I do this?_
How do you stimulate the feeling you want to convey?

You evoke an emotion by drawing associations through language: color choices, words, and situations.

**Colors**:
Red (bravery, strength, aggression, anger).
Orange (safety, fun, passion, frustration).
Yellow (emotionality, friendliness, fear, depression).
Green (harmony, peace, stagnation, blandness).
Blue (serenity, order, aloofness, coldness).
Violet (spirituality, truth, decadence, repression).
Pink (nurturing, warmth, inhibition, vulnerability).
Brown (naturalness, reliability, humorless, simple).
Black (solidity, reassurance, menace, heaviness).
White (purity, simplicity, sterility, exclusiveness).

Once you have a color that corresponds to the emotion,
think about the sorts of things you associate with that color.
Forests are green, water is blue, caves are black, ice is white.
A peasant village can be earthy browns and greens,
while a martial fortress can be red-painted brick blazing in the sun.
A mysterious artifact can be violet, with flashes of other colors
from gemstones embedded into it.
A peaceful creature sent on a rampage might have red blood
smearing its green scales, showing the dominance of anger over peace.

You can take elements of the game already in play (places, NPCs, and so on),
and ask "what could happen to these things that would provoke this emotion?"
For example, a foreign military power capturing peaceful villagers
would probably evoke anger in your player characters,
so the slave camp where they are being kept would be an Anger-based discovery.

### Creating Challenges for Discoveries

A simple approach is to make three Challenges.

1. The first one will **embody or provoke the emotion** you want the Discovery to suggest
2. The second one will **escalate the action or the drama** inherent in the Discovery
3. The third one will **provide a climax and a feeling of closure** for interacting with the Discovery

For example, a Discovery might be a military slave camp where peaceful villagers
are being held captive.
The dominant emotion of this Discovery is anger.

The first Challenge for the PCs is a group of guards, away from the camp,
who are brutally whipping or beating an adult villager.
The PCs must intervene, both to defeat the guards
and to prevent any from escaping to raise the alarm.

The second Challenge might involve more guards (if one escaped),
a rescue attempt to recover more villagers (from the camp, or perhaps somewhere nearby),
and so on.
The stakes are higher, but the players are hopefully now invested in the Discovery thanks to the first Challenge.

The third can be the recovery of some key villagers who can organize a resistance,
or even the PCs leading a direct attack on the commandant of the camp.

## Threads

Threads are specific story ideas you want your character to experience.
Threads are the way your character gains experience and grows stronger.

A Thread isn't an ongoing mission or a motivation.
Something like "Overthrow the evil empire" is too long and too open to be a Thread.
A Thread is an achievable short-term goal.
You can tell a large, multi-part story with your character's Threads,
but you don't have to.
For example, Tana starts the game with a Thread:
"The Old Ruin Near Home".
That story may continue on other Threads,
or she can do something different.

You don't have to know how the story will end.
You should know how it will start.
For example, you can have a Thread such as
"find the lady's stolen jewelry".
You might round up the usual suspects, or look for known jewel thieves.
You don't have to know who the actual thief was when you start the Thread.
Perhaps it wasn't stolen at all!
You'll discover what happens as you play the game.

When you start a new Thread, you get five **milestones**.
When you reach a Discovery or face a Challenge,
you can mark off a milestone.
This means that the encounter will become part of your story.
The MC should keep this in mind when describing what comes after that.
For example, Tana has a Thread called "The Old Ruin Near Home".
During a fight with a pack of Slimes, she loses her weapon to one of the creatures.
She marks off a milestone.
She declares that one of the defeated Slimes might have grabbed something shiny from the Ruin.
The MC agrees, and Tana recovers a bauble that will help her open the magic locks in the depths of the ruins.

Two or more characters can use a milestone to lay claim to a Discovery or Challenge.
If this happens, the group should discuss the way their stories might intersect.
For example, Tana is trying to unlock an ancient grimoire.
Meanwhile, Basler is chasing the real thief of a valuable necklace.
They can both encounter a street gang.
Tana and Basler both use a milestone to claim the gang's Challenge.
They agree that the necklace a magic pendant that will unlock the grimoire
if recovered.

A character's Thread should find its conclusion on the last milestone.
The group can end a story early, or allow it to run longer, if they feel it's appropriate.

Once a character finishes their Thread, they get to advance immediately
(see "Advancement").
You should base a character's advancement choices on the outcome of the Thread, but you don't have to.
For example, a character who finds a grimoire of magic may
gain the "Mage" Archetype as a result.

Once all characters have finished their Threads,
everybody gets to start a new Thread.
You can continue a larger or longer story,
or do something new.

Example Threads:

* Find my mother's missing pendant
* Uncover the real person who stole the lady's jewels
* Arrest the thief Basler!
* Discover the mystery at the heart of the forest
* Learn swordplay from a suitable teacher
* Navigate the cave in search of rumored treasure
* Break the curse the witch placed on me

## Starting Archetypes

### Adventurer

There are many types of adventurers: people who like to explore the world,
and have their own ways of surviving the dangers along the way.
Pick one of six types of adventurer:
Brave, Clever, Cool, Curious, Determined, or Mysterious.

**Words**:

* **Confront** (4 &#9734;) (if you are Brave, Cool, Mysterious),
* **Resist** (4 &#9734;) (if you are Brave, Curious, Determined),
* **Avoid** (4 &#9734;) (Clever, Determined, Mysterious),
* **Outwit** (4 &#9734;) (if you are Clever, Cool, Curious)

**Pools**: Resolve (&#9825;)

**Confront** (4 &#9734;):
You tackle a Challenge head-on, with fists, weapons, words, or simply determination.
You typically Confront monsters, angry villagers, or ancient spirits.

**Resist** (4 &#9734;):
You endure a Challenge, coming out ahead by surviving it or adapting to it.
You typically Resist hostile enchantments, deadly poison, terrible weather,
rock slides, and many other hazards.

**Avoid** (4 &#9734;):
You dodge, hide from, sneak around, misdirect,
or otherwise avoid a direct confrontation with a Challenge.
You typically Avoid lethal area attacks, guards on patrol,
sharp blades on traps in a dungeon, and so forth.

**Outwit** (4 &#9734;):
You figure something out, remember something you've learned,
analyze something, or notice something that lets you defeat the Challenge.
You typically Outwit weird magical traps,
humanoids speaking a strange language, or doors covered in fiendish riddles.

**Resolve** (&#9825;):
Your physical endurance, your spirit, your strength of will,
combining to allow you to continue your journey and your fight.
**Special**: Recharge Resolve whenever you reach a Discovery.

## Optional Rules

If you want to add more detail around injuries and gear, you can use these optional rules.

### Conditions

Tana breaks her leg, and Sir Emory sets it as best he can with a quick prayer of healing.
But she'll be hobbling for awhile, which will make things more difficult...

How do we model that?
By creating Words that represent some kind of deleterious condition.
The MC gives Tana a "With a Broken Leg" Word with an activation cost of 5.
Every action she takes where the leg is a serious impediment must include that Word.

### Equipment

Many adventurers care about the equipment they're carrying around.
You can model this using a combination of Words and Pools.

For example, the MC might give the characters a "Health Potion" Pool.
They can drink a potion, using dice from the pool when resisting damage
or overcoming poison.

### Limit Break

Many traditional RPG video games have a "Limit Break" or "Overdrive"
type mechanic, allowing characters to power up and defeat opponents.
You can simulate such things with a new Pool.

**Limit Break** (&#9825;):
You surpass your mortal limits and shine with power.
**Special**: This pool may be used for any action.
You must take all dice from this Pool when using it.
The MC may give dice to this pool at their discretion,
such as when the character takes damage, faces a stressful
situation, and so on.

## Sample World: Talispire

This is a sample world for Grand Adventure.
You can use it in your own games,
adapt its archetypes and characters to your own world,
or create an entirely different world.

### History

Long ago, Talispire was dominated by the **Cirrus Empire**.
From their floating city of **Zebulon**, they ruled the primitive surface-dwelling tribes.
Their science, called **mechanistry**, fused technology and magical power.

Everything changed centuries ago, when Zebulon rose uncontrollably into the sky
and disappeared, never to return.
The Cirran provincial governors on the ground, left without the support of
their mechanist troops and weapons, were at the mercy of the people
they had once subjugated.
Some of the provinces had been run fairly and kindly.
Their rulers became kings and queens, and entrusted the provinces to their children
or other worthy heirs.
Most of the provinces were run strictly, with harsh rules.
They were overthrown by angry mobs and their castles were destroyed.

Today, Talispire is a lushly alive and vital world.
Green forests and crop fields surround the sleepy hamlets and bustling towns of mankind.
Rocky "skylands" levitate over rolling hills and fertile valleys.
The castles and laboratories of the old Cirrans sometimes still stand,
whether standing proudly aboveground, floating freely in the sky,
or buried deep underground.
They are joined by roughly-crafted fortresses and sprawling cities,
made by the surface-dwellers from sturdy wood and reliable rock.

Some of the old mechanistry can still be found, and much of it is dangerous.
The powers of magic are equally risky to the unprepared:
fantastic creatures of myth, such as basilisks and ghosts,
arise from the primal wild magic of the earth.

### Dragons

"Dragon" is what people call the ancient primal spirits of the world.
Dragons are defined by their greed and their power, but they can be
held back through force of will, acts of courage, and defiance.
The heroes of story and song who resisted dragons are revered as "saints".

Some dragons are massive beyond comprehension.
The whole world of Talispire is sometimes said to be
a coiled-up dragon within an egg, waiting to hatch.
Other dragons are nimble monsters, lurking in caves and forests,
flying like shadows over sleeping cities,
sometimes taking hapless travelers or whole caravans by surprise.
Dragons are spirits, but form bodies out of the elements: wood,
ice, soil, even volcanic magma.

The Holy Church of Talispire recognizes hundreds of saints,
and catalogs and studies the dragon spirits.

### Races

Two other races share Talispire with humanity.

The **Zelves** were created by the Cirrus Empire
to be temporary hosts for their souls, and living repositories of memory.
The Cirrans could project their souls into a Zelf body, possessing it or a time.
Freed of their enslavement as vessels for their masters and makers,
the Zelves had retreated into the forests,
to consider who and what they should become.
Zelves possess great wisdom and expertise,
but they lack direction and prefer quiet contemplation to action and change.
Zelves are immortal, mysterious beings, graceful and slender,
with an ethereal and peaceful nature.

The Zelves are pretty clearly the elf counterpart in the game.
Their job is to be grave and mysterious and live in the forests.
That said, they have excellent reasons for being grave and mysterious.
{.directors-cut}

The **Gnomads**, like the Zelves, were engineered by the Cirrans.
They were originally a slave-race, meant to maintain their masters' mechanistry.
Without the empire to command them, they turned to an independent existence.
Gnomads value their freedom and love to travel.
Gnomads are intuitively gifted with an understanding of how things connect,
whether it's technology or the human heart.
They form small mobile communities, traveling both on roads and in secret
underground tunnels known only to their own kind,
trading their wares and skills for supplies and companionship.
They are short and stout, but surprisingly nimble and fast.

Gnomads are the Dwarf/Gnome archetype. They're tinkerers,
but they're also good with people because I hate dour dwarves.
I wanted the Dwarves of "the Hobbit", who pile into a dude's house
and start messing with his whole program, then sing a song about it.

Your physical shape and size may allow you to carry loads, or even passengers.
Use the Druid Archetype, replacing "Cleanse" with "Maul".

* **Maul** (4 &#9734;):
  You scream and leap, charging and clawing at a hapless and terrified target.
  **Pool**: Instinct.

You can get a lot of mileage by rearranging Pool or Word choices
from another Archetype.
If a player wants to build on their existing investment in Pools,
it's okay to adjust an Archetype to match what they want.

Druids enforce the natural order by adopting the shapes of wild animals.
They fuse primal physical power with a thinking person's intellect,

Use the Paladin Archetype, replacing "Smite" with "Shoot",
and the "Holy" Pool with "Tech" as described under Engineer.

**Illusionist**

The use of illusion magic is not obvious and
won't automatically mark you as the origin of the spell.

* **Obfuscate** (4 &#9734;):

  Your strength of will and spirit, and determination in the face of danger.
  **Recharge**: face incredible odds without flinching, or relate a story of bravery and risk.

The logic of the "For Honor" Word might not be immediately apparent.
Why would I add a Word that makes me roll a die, and then gives me a die back?
Because you can Level Up that Word, making it a net source of dice.
You have to invest in the Knight to make that a viable strategy.
This isn't intended to make the Knight more powerful than other archetypes,
just to illustrate variations in mechanics.
{.directors-cut}

**Mage**

A student of the arcane, who wields magic spells.
**Special**: A mage's spells are accompanied by obvious indicators -
magic circles on the ground, concentric rings of energy surrounding their hands,

  Your reserve of magical power.
  **Recharge**: meditate after an extended rest, or expose yourself to any significant source of mystic power.

Magic Knight is one of those Archetypes that isn't meant to be taken
straight away. It's better balanced if you take either Fighter or Mage first.
That said, the ability to drop up to ten dice on a two-Word Action
is pretty amazing.
{.directors-cut}

**Mechanism**

An artificial lifeform: a robot, a mechanist construct, an alchemical golem,
or something similar.
**Special**: You are powered by electricity rather than food and drink.
You are immune to disease and many mortal ailments,

* **Crush** (4 &#9734;):
  You use your brute strength to reduce obstacles to fragments.
  **Pools**: Tech

Called upon during wartime to do dishonorable but pragmatic missions.
Often found as the secret police of an Eastern state.

* **With Ninja Magic** (1):
  You can fool enemies, transform your body, and many other amazing
  feats by channeling the subtle energy inside yourself.
  **Pool**: Qi, Stealth.
* **Qi** (&#9825;):
  Your inner reserves of subtle power, which flow like water through the body.

* **Stealth** (&#9825;):
  Your ability to hide in shadows, avoid detection, and go unnoticed.
  **Recharge**: make effort to disappear from sight and stay hidden.

Like the Magic Knight, the Ninja is a second-tier Archetype
that does a certain thing with two Pools.
In this case, it needs an action Word from somewhere else,
but you can use "With Ninja Magic" to drop two Pools' worth of dice
onto that Action, whether it's combat, stealth, puzzle solving, or whatever.
Pretty flexible.
{.directors-cut}

**Oracle**

  You strike down evil with a blaze of power.
  **Pools**: Courage, Holy.
* **Courage** (&#9825;):
  Your strength of will and spirit, and determination in the face of danger.
  **Recharge**: face incredible odds without flinching, or relate a story of bravery and risk.
* **Holy** (&#9825;):
  Your connection to the divine and ability to call out sacred power.
  **Recharge**: Meditate after an extended rest,
  or be in the presence of an icon of your faith or a miracle of your patron.

**Prince/Princess**

A member of royalty who goes on adventures for their own reasons.
Their strength is their kindness and good heart,
and not only a willingness but an ability to see the true natures of others.
**Special**: as royalty, you have authority over the good folk of a certain kingdom,
and you may exercise it when you are there.

* **Befriend** (4 &#9734;):
  You overcome hatred and fear through perseverance,
  convincing someone to give up hostility and cooperate with you.
  **Pool**: Charm.

  Your spirit and purity allow you to see through any difficulty.
  **Pool**: Charm.
* **Charm** (&#9825;):
  Your charisma, persuasiveness, and inspiration.
  **Recharge**: Befriend someone or tell a fascinating story, regardless of its truthfulness.

The Princess is inspired by the Dungeon World playbook of the same name.
It's here to show that you can run a totally non-combat character
who is as mechanically effective as anyone else.
If you need examples of the Princess in play, watch
"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind" and watch how few times she actually pulls a trigger.

**Ranger**

A tracker, woodsman, and practical naturalist.
Rangers hunt primarily with traps and snares,
though many learn the bow or sword to take down dangerous prey.

  hunting your own food, etc. - to reconnect with the world.

The Ranger is an example of an Archetype synthesis.
For a fully effective bow-wielding, animal-friend-having honest to goodness
RANGER from D&D, you can plug in this Ranger, plus Beastmaster and Fighter.
That gives you someone with combat talent, one or more pets,
plus traps and snares.

A gambler, con artist, or traveling rogue.
When a smooth tongue won't work, deft hands fill in.

### Places

**The Sleepy Village**

The place where Tana starts her adventures.
A cluster of huts, with conical white roofs.
Thin streams of smoke coil upwards from numerous chimneys.
The emerald green of a vibrantly alive forest rises all around.
Mountains rise in the distance.
There is a path that meanders between the buildings,
leading to the one and only road out of town.

**The Old Ruin**

In a clearing in the forest, pale marble walls rise from the soil.
They form irregular and intricate shapes.
There is an oppressive largeness to everything.
Doors and archways fit frames much too big for humans.

The ruin should evoke _fear_.
The characters are here to discover something:
what treasure or hidden secrets lie inside?

Everything about the ruins is monochrome, in contrast to the growing greenery outside.
Plant life has sundered the floor tiles and attempts to grow through the cracks,
but there is a dividing line deep inside the ruins where the growth
abruptly ends.
Black shadows loom across the walls.
Here and there, red splashes can be found on the walls.
Is it the remnant of paint? Or is it blood?

**The Bustling City**

At the end of the road, and the beginning of many others,
the city stands with open arms, greeting travelers.
The goods of a thousand caravans are on offer in the bazaars.
The hands of merchants, officials, and thieves wait to luck coin purses
from the pockets of the unwary.

The city should evoke _surprise_.
Everything is new here for novice characters.
The characters are here to find something:
the answers to a mystery, a lost or stolen item,
the fate of a friend or family member.
The newness of the city and the strange ways of city folk are the obstacles in their search.

The city walls are brown stone.
Red banners of bravery fly over mercenary halls and proclaim the presence of the Crown's forces.
Yellow and violet paint marks the signs of inns, taverns, and eateries.
The roads are a pale, almost creamy colored cobblestone.
Water fountains spray their pure blue water into the air.
The voices of buyers and sellers ring out from morning to dusk.
During the evening, the buildings are dark, with slivers
of flickering orange light emanating from the window shutters.
The people move from outside to inside when day becomes night,
to conclude their business and engage in revelry.

Buildings are roofed with sharply slanted inclines,
a contrast to the sleepy village's gently rounded shapes.
Everything is angles here, like the sharp turns of a street corner.
A trio of cutthroats waits near you in the alley, watching and whispering.

* The Highroad
* The Mysterious Forest
* The Ancient Cave Tunnels
* The Primordial Valley

### Sample Characters

**Tana**

A spunky, outgoing girl from a sleepy country village.
She dresses in country garb,
and carries a rusty sword from her father's days as a soldier.

* **Archetypes**: Brave Determined Adventurer
* **Words**: Confront (4 &#9734;), Resist (4 &#9734;&#9734;), Avoid (4 &#9734;)
* **Pools**: Resolve (&#9825;&#9825;)

she will discover a grimoire (a book of magic spells), and learn to be a Mage.
Later on, she will meet up with a Gnomic caravan,
where she is equipped with a new sword and armor, and become a Magic Knight.

The traditional RPG protagonist character is a young male off on adventure.
This character gender-flipped that premise without any other changes being necessary.
{.directors-cut}

**Basler**

A selfish rogue of no great moral character,
who lives and plies his unsavory trade in the city.
Meeting Tana, the least cynical person he'd ever encountered,
changed his way of thinking.
He wears dirty leathers and carries two sharp daggers.

but using his skills for good.
Later, he'll meet a mysterious but familiar old man, and become a Ninja.

**Emory Hawthorne**

A young and inexperienced, but noble, squire.
Assigned to track down the thief Basler,
only to fall in with the group upon seeing Tana's influence on him
(and being more than a little impressed with the girl herself).

* **Words**: Resist (4 &#9734;&#9734;), Avoid (4 &#9734;), Outwit (4 &#9734;)
* **Pools**: Resolve (&#9825;&#9825;)

At the end of "A Squire's Duty", he becomes Sir Emory and is made a proper Knight.
Later, he'll learn the defensive arts of the order of St. Rinadh,
and become a Paladin.

**Woody**

A young forest-dweller who wears thick overlapping cloth to conceal their features.
They guide Tana and her friends through a dangerous woodland,
and are inspired to leave the forest and join the group.
They have frequent discussions with Basler about laws and authority.
They carry a bow made of living wood, with a bowstring made of an actual vine.

* **Archetypes**: Clever Cool Adventurer
* **Words**: Confront (4 &#9734;), Avoid (4 &#9734;), Outwit (4 &#9734;&#9734;)
* **Pools**: Resolve (&#9825;&#9825;)
* **Threads**: Secret in the Forest
* **Flair**: Piercing Green Eyes, Face-Covering Veil, Vine Bow

In reality, "Woody" is Princess Emerald who escaped a nearby kingdom
and has been living in the forest for the past few years.
At the end of "Secret in the Forest", she will bring some animal companions
with her, becoming a Beastmaster.
Later, she'll acknowledge her royal heritage to become a Princess,
embrace her life in the wild and become a Ranger, or perhaps both.

Woody is the sort of character who exemplifies what the game is good at.
Is she secretly a Princess? Is she actually a Ranger?
The answer is that she is _both_, and _more_. She can be whatever she wants to be.

All characters begin the game with the following Pool.

**Dragon Blood** (&#9825;&#9825;&#9825;&#9825;&#9825;):
The primal power of the Dragon Gods stirs within you and wakens,
unleashing tremendous magical might but acting on your instincts
and whims rather than reasoned thought.

This Pool begins at zero dice.
The MC may give dice to this Pool when you face a personal crisis.
You may use this Pool for any action.
If you take any dice from this Pool, you must take them all.

### Sample Challenges

2 &#x25A1; (more slimes appear),
3 &#x25A1; (lots of slimes!)

**Escape the Prison!**

The characters have been captured by the authorities and imprisoned!
For whatever reason, a fair trial seems unlikely. Time to escape.

**Encounter with a Dragon!**

The characters encounter a Dragon somewhere deep and mysterious:
the heart of a forest, the final room of a cave system,
an aerie high atop a misty mountain.
The Dragon can be fought, bargained with, or avoided, but never
truly killed.

**Endurance**:
10 &#x25A1;&#x25A1; (encounter with the dragon on the ground),

**Features**:

* Flying (10). The dragon takes to the air, avoiding melee attacks and ground-bound attackers.

**Twists**:

* Claws! (&#9825;): You are hit and begin to bleed.
* Tail Swipe! (&#9825;&#9825;): You are knocked to your feet and must scramble out of the way of further attacks.

* Thousand Limbs! (&#9825;&#9825;&#9825;): The dragon uses its environment as an extension of its body - vine tendrils, earthy shackles, etc.
* Chink in the Armor! (&#9825;&#9825;&#9825;&#9825;&#9825;): If you somehow manage to find and target it, the dragon will take considerable damage.
