title: Grand Adventure
---

_Past the stone walls that divide your village from the fairy forest,
there's a glow coming from that old cave..._

_In the attic of your family's cottage,
there is a rusty sword that begins to sing one night..._

_This morning your mother woke you up,
and you find yourself meeting the strange girl with a mysterious pendant..._

Every map has blanks.
Every story has gaps.
Every old ruin has secrets.
And every person has a dream: to experience those mysteries.
To chart a course into the unknown. To explore. To adventure.

Grand Adventure is a roleplaying game,
telling stories about **how adventurers work together to
discover amazing new things, solve challenges, and explore a fantastic world**.

## How to Play

You need several people to be players, at least two but not more than five or so.
One person will take the "MC" role (described below).
The others will have individual player characters, or "PCs".
Everyone who plays will need several six-sided dice (d6),
and paper and pencils for note-taking.

### How to be a player

As a player, you **narrate the actions of your player character**,
as they adventure in a fictional world you and your friends create together.
You say the things your character would say,
describe the things your character would do.

**Fictional license** is permission to narrate something about the game world.
Most characters can walk, pick up objects, and speak,
so you can freely describe your character doing these things.
A character with a sword can use it to block attacks or cut things,
but probably can't make an energy beam come out of the blade
(unless the sword is magical)
or turn it into a stack of gold (unless it's really magical).

Players have fictional license over their own characters,
and over whatever parts of the game world the MC permits,
but do not have license to narrate for other players' characters without their permission.

### How to be the MC

"MC" stands for "Master of Ceremonies".
In this game, stories are created together by the group,
with contributions from the game rules.
The MC's role is to help weave these stories into a coherent whole and propel them along.
The MC can tell stories too, just like any other player,
but the MC's special role is to **set a consistent tone for the stories the players tell**.
Like the conductor of an orchestra,
the MC's job is not to make the music,
but to keep everyone else's performance in harmony.

In order to do their job, the MC doesn't have their own PC,
but does have fictional license to speak for every part of the game world.
In addition, while the group should collectively agree on what's possible
for a given character,
the MC has final authority over fictional license for other players.
The MC should be permissive in allowing players to drive story forward,
and only intervene to maintain the tone.

What is the "tone"? It's the **feelings you want to get from the story**
and the **expectations you have for the story**.
In a game driven by optimism and hope, you generally expect happy endings,
minimal bloody violence, and consistent loyalties.
In darker games, betrayals of trust, tragic deaths, and moral dilemmas are the norm.
You have several tools for setting the tone.
You can use word choices, like "killed" vs. "defeated", or narrative choices,
like "the enemies surrender" vs. "the enemies fight to the death".
The group should discuss the specific tone they want for their game,
but the MC has the authority to enforce it during the game.

### How to use these rules

The game itself is just a set of rules.
You use these rules to **spark, frame, and support a conversation about the fiction**.
So what does that mean?

**The fiction** is the name for the world of wonder, mystery,
and excitement that you all are imagining and describing together,
and for the events that take place in that world.
When you say "there's a lumbering Ogre with a stout wooden club,
and it takes a swing at Tana's head", that's the fiction.

**The conversation** about that fiction is what you, the players,
say to each other about the world, your characters, and what is or should be going on.
When you say "I think the Ogre should have a spear instead of a club",
or when the MC asks the players, "what is Tana doing about the Ogre?",
that is part of the conversation.

**The rules give you a vocabulary for having this conversation**.
When you see rules for Pools, Actions, Challenges, or Discoveries, for example,
these are tools for the MC and the other players to give a structure to what's happening.
Is the Ogre particularly tough or wimpy?
Its Action Cost will determine how easily you can attack it.
How long will the Ogre last in a fight before it's defeated?
Giving it a Pool lets you track damage done to it,
until it is hurt badly enough to run away.

The rules will help you take players from one Discovery to another,
facing Challenges along the way.
Each Challenge is dealt with by characters performing Actions.
A character's Actions are formed from the Words they have access to.
Performing Actions will deplete the characters' Pools,
which are eventually recharged at the next Discovery.

Use the rules when the group doesn't already know the answer to a question posed by the story,
such as "can we defeat the Ogre?"
If the MC narrates the presence of an Ogre and frames it as a Challenge,
the players are being asked to use the rules for Challenges to deal with it.
But the rules are tools for moving the game forward,
not a straitjacket preventing the players from creating a shared story.
If just swatting the Ogre aside is more appropriate to maintain the feel of the game,
then narrating that action is sufficient.

### Words and Intent

A rule of the game is that
**players should honor the intent of their fellow players' words**.
Here's some examples of this principle in action.

If the MC tells you that your character steps into a "mysterious temple",
what do you imagine?
Perhaps soft lighting coming through a stained glass window,
coming from an unknown source.
Shelves feature books written in an old language.
On the wall are inscribed holy symbols belonging to ancient gods.
Gently glowing crystal orbs hanging on the walls.

But say that instead, the MC tells you that it's an "eldritch fane".
A fane is a temple, and "eldritch" can mean "mysterious",
but the whole feeling is different.
Perhaps now there's an altar in your imagination, stained with
something's - or someone's - blood.
The walls are darker.
Jagged runes spell out dark portents.
The PCs should not feel as comfortable in such a place,
because the MC is signaling danger and menace.

If a player tells the MC that her character has a Word called "Befriend",
that clearly signals the sort of actions she wants her PC to take.
The MC shouldn't interpret that as "Intimidate" or "Provoke".
Likewise, if the MC says that a creature is "forbidding" or "dangerous",
only truly heroic action can justify using an action like "Befriend" to overcome that creature.

## Quick Character Creation

Pick a **name** for your character.

Pick two **adjectives** that describe your character:
Brave, Clever, Cool, Curious, Determined, or Mysterious.
Write them down, followed by "Adventurer", as your first **Archetype**.
For example, "Brave Cool Adventurer".
You'll gain other Archetypes, like "Ninja", "Knight", or "Werewolf", as you play the game.

Words are how you describe your actions in the game.
You'll gain more Words, or create your own,
as you play and discover the sort of adventurer you want to be.

Write down the **Words** you start with, based on which adjectives you picked:

* Confront (if you picked Brave, Cool, or Mysterious)
* Resist (if you picked Brave, Curious, or Determined)
* Avoid (if you picked Clever, Determined, or Mysterious)
* Know About (if you picked Clever, Cool, or Curious)

Write a **star** (&#9734;) next to each Word you start with.
If you picked two adjectives that give you the same Word,
write two stars (&#9734;&#9734;).
More stars mean you are more experienced using that Word.

Write down a **Pool**: "Resolve (&#9825;&#9825;)".

Pools are your ability to keep doing what you do.
They measure your health, fatigue, sneakiness, magical power, and many other things.
When you use your Words, their cost is paid for by rolling dice from your Pools.
Your "Resolve" Pool comes with being an adventurer,
and is your grit in the face of adversity.

Think up a concept or a pitch for the first story you want to tell about your character,
and write it down under **Threads**.
For example, "Searching for an ancient family sword".
You don't have to know how this story will end, only how it will start.

Finally, think about some visual **flair**.
Flair is some trait, accessory, or habit that embodies one of your adjectives
or suggests the Thread you'll be chasing.
A wooden sword, a special pendant, a thick book, goggles, an unusual hair color,
heterochromatic eyes, and many other things can be flair.

Now you're ready to adventure!

## Pools

A Pool is how you track something you lose or regain often,
like willpower, stamina, stealth, wealth, or magical power.
Pools have a name, like "Resolve", "Mana", or "Rage".

**A Pool holds dice**.
Each Pool has some number of six-sided dice (d6) in it.

**Pools have a current and maximum size**.
The current size is how many dice are in the Pool at the moment.
The maximum size is how many dice can ever be in the Pool at a time.
The Pool's maximum size is measured in **hearts** (&#9825;).

**Pools can have dice Taken from them or Given to them**.
Any dice Taken from a Pool are not automatically returned.
Only Give dice to a pool when a rule tells you to do so.

**Pools can be Recharged**.
If a rule tells you to recharge a Pool, Give it dice up to its maximum size.

**A Pool can be Lent to someone or something**.
Your target receives a Pool temporarily.
If the rule that lends the Pool doesn't specify how many dice it has,
Give it one.
If the rule doesn't specify a current size for the Pool, it starts at its maximum size.
A lent Pool is removed from the target's character sheet when its current size reaches zero.
If you lend someone a Pool they already have,
you can give it dice instead, up to its maximum.
If you lend someone a Pool you have as well, you don't lose it.

**A Pool can be Leveled Up**.
Add one die to the Pool's maximum size, permanently, and Recharge the Pool.
You cannot Level Up a Pool that's been lent to you.

**Pools can have optional rules**.
For example, the Resolve Pool will Recharge whenever you reach a new Discovery,
while the Stealth Pool might Recharge only when you are sneaking around.

**Pools with the same name are the same Pool**.
If your Wizard has an "MP" Pool for magical power,
and you also become a Cleric that also has an "MP" Pool,
you have one MP Pool, not two.

## Words

A Word is a verb, noun, adjective, or phrase with special significance in the game.
Words tell your group about the actions you are performing,
and optionally give you special rules for performing those actions.

A Word can contain multiple English words.
"Giant Lizard" is a Word in the game-mechanical sense.

**Words signal intention**.
"Confront" and "Avoid" mean different things in the fiction,
even if they use the same rules.
"Defeat" is not the same as "Kill", or "Assassinate".
Listen to what the Word tells you, and honor what it means.
Words can come with a description that explain their meaning more clearly.

**Words can have optional rules**.
For example, a Word might say "The Stealth Pool may be used"
or "Lend a friendly target a Magic Shield Pool".

**Words have an activation cost**.
To include the Word in an action,
you must allocate dice to the Word that sum to the cost or higher.
For example, a Word with cost 4 can be activated with a roll of 4 or higher,
or two dice showing 1 and 3, and so on.

**Words can optionally have a Star rating**.
Write a Word's activation cost as "cost stars", e.g. 2 &#9734;&#9734;.
Words cannot have more than five stars.
Stars allow the player to recover dice from their action - one die per star.

**A Word can be Leveled Up**.
Add one star (&#9734;) to the Word, permanently.
No Word can be Leveled Up to more than five stars.
Words without a star rating cannot be Leveled Up.

**The same name with the same rules always refers to the same Word**.
For example, the Fighter and Knight might both have an "Attack" Word.
If a Fighter also became a Knight, she only has one "Attack" Word, not two.
You should try never to use the same Word but different rules.
Instead, pick a new Word.

### Setting Word costs

Most action Words will have a cost of 4.
Most modifier Words will have a cost of 1.
Challenge Words are set by the difficulty of the Challenge.

The MC may adjust Word costs in play.
A powerful Word might cost 1 or 2 more points than normal.

## Archetypes

An Archetype is a collection of traits that describe a sort of character,
like Fighter, Magic User, Elf, or Werewolf.
Characters can have multiple Archetypes.
For example, a character can be an Elf/Magic User/Fighter.

A character doesn't have to have an Archetype to describe themselves as something.
For example, a player can say "my character is an Elf"
without starting with the Elf Archetype.
It's only when they want to put a spotlight on their Elf-ness that
the Archetype becomes important.

**Archetypes come with a set of Pools and Words**.
A typical Archetype should have one or two Words and one or two Pools
that work together to support the Archetype's theme.
For example, a Fighter might have "Attack" and "Bravely" Words,
and a "Courage" Pool.
When you gain that Archetype, you gain those Words and Pools.

**Archetypes can share Words and Pools**.
If you gain a new Archetype that has a Word or Pool you already have,
you should Level Up the Word or Pool instead of taking it a second time.
For example, a Fighter with the "Attack" Word who becomes a Knight
will Level Up his Attack, rather than gaining it a second time.

## Challenges

A Challenge is anything in the fiction that confronts the characters
and forces them to resolve it before they can continue.
An encounter with wandering monsters, an avalanche blocking the valley,
and an out-of-control magic spell can all be Challenges.

Challenges must be _interesting_ and _difficult_ but not _impossible_.
A hidden elf village with homes growing organically out of the trunks of
giant trees can be interesting, but doesn't pose any difficulty by itself.
But if the elves living there are hostile to the PCs,
and must be won over somehow, that is a Challenge.
Similarly, trekking through an endless desert can be difficult,
but probably isn't interesting - the players would probably rather not roll
to forage for water daily, for example.
If there's an Ancient Red Dragon and it's impossible to beat it somehow,
it's unfair to present it as a Challenge.
The MC should simply narrate its actions, such as setting fire to a village.

**Challenges are situations, not creatures**.
The Challenge is not "the red dragon",
and the Challenge doesn't necessarily end if the Dragon itself dies.
Similarly, the Challenge might be resolved by successfully hiding from
or sneaking past the Dragon, rather than fighting or killing it.

**Challenges have a difficulty rating**.
Typical difficulty ratings are between 1 (the simplest monsters, like Slimes,
that novice adventurers can beat)
and 20 (giant or powerful monsters such as dragons, kraken, and the like).

**Challenges have an endurance**.
This is measured in squares (&#x25A1;), usually two or more.
As a general rule, the more PCs you have,
the more squares of endurance your Challenges should have,
so that everybody has a chance to act against them.

Depleting squares isn't just a matter of wearing down a monster's hit points.
Rather, it represents the different stages of confronting a Challenge.
For example, the party might fight a dragon!
It might have one or more squares representing the following stages:

1. The dragon starts on the ground, using its claws and tail to attack.
2. The dragon takes to the air and attacks at range.
3. The dragon breathes fire on the nearby village.
4. The dragon flies faster and must be forced down.
5. The dragon is desperate and fights with everything.

Every successful Action against a Challenge depletes one of its squares.
When a Challenge has no squares left, it's resolved.
Characters can pay the activation cost for a Challenge multiple times,
depleting one extra squares, as part of the same action.

For example, Tana is fighting Slimes.
They're easy to beat (difficulty 2) but have 5 squares.
Tana rolls 3 dice, getting 2, 3, and 5.
She assigns all these dice to the Slime Word,
and depletes 3 of the Challenge's squares.

Each squares of endurance might have a different difficulty rating.
For example, a situation that gets progressively more difficult might have
an endurance like this: 10 &#x25A1;&#x25A1;, 15 &#x25A1;&#x25A1;, 20 &#x25A1;.
Clearing the first two squares each has a difficulty of 10,
the next two has 15, and the final one has 20.

**Challenges are also Words**.
Their activation cost is their difficulty rating when used in an Action.

**Challenges can come with their own Twists**.
For example, a dragon can have Twists like "fiery breath!",
or a slime can divide when struck,
creating multiple smaller slimes.
Even if a Challenge specifies some Twists, the MC isn't required to use them.

**Challenges can have Features**.
Features are Words that sometimes come into play,
depending on how the characters approach the Challenge,
or what a Challenge does in response to their actions.
The MC determines the activation cost of a feature,
and whether or not it's important to include in a particular action.

For example, a Swordfighter can attack a Red Dragon (difficulty 10)
while it's crouched in its lair with an action like "Attack Red Dragon".
But out in the open, the beast might spread its wings and take to the air,
adding a "Flying" feature (cost 10).
The Swordfighter must now "Attack Flying Red Dragon", using both Words.
On the other hand, her comrade the Elven Archer can "Shoot Red Dragon"
without including the feature,
because his arrows can strike even a flying Dragon.

The MC can rule that character actions or Twists can bring features into or out of play.
For example, the Elven Archer might declare "I'm shooting at the dragon's wings
to try and ground it",
allowing the Swordfighter to renew her attack once the Dragon crashes to the ground.

## Actions

When you are dealing with a Challenge, you take Actions to overcome it.
Start by telling the group the sort of thing you're going to do about the Challenge.

For example, when you see an Ogre attacking a helpless villager,
Tana's player might say "I draw my sword and charge right for the Ogre,
yelling at it to get its attention!"

**Actions are made up of Words**.
Based on your narration, you decide which Words you have that meet that description.
The Words you pick should tell you _what's being done_, _to whom or to what_,
and optionally _how_.

For example, Tana has an "Attack" Word
that lets her charge into melee against dangerous creatures.
She also has a "Crystal Sword" Word, which is the magic weapon she uses.
When she encounters a Slime monster in a dungeon,
she can use "Slime" as a Word too.
She puts the Words together: "Attack", "Slime", "Crystal Sword" -
"I'm attacking this Slime using my Crystal Sword".

**You must include any Words that the MC requires**.
For example, if the Challenge has features that are relevant,
add those features as Words.

**Most of your time in resolving an Action should be spent narrating**.
Actions represent a series of outcomes, exchanges of sword-blows,
tense seconds spent running from cave-ins, and the like.
Actions are meant to capture the entirety of how characters respond
to a given challenge in a given way,
rather than being moment-by-moment indicators of combat.

**Actions cannot be repeated**.
Your Action represents the totality of your efforts doing a particular thing.
Rather than a single sword swing,
an Attack action represents a series of attacks and counter-attacks.

Once you have used a particular combination of Words against a given Challenge,
you must change at least one Word next time.
This includes any features that the Challenge has.

For example, Tana cannot "Attack Ogre" a second time,
once she's done it the first time.
But she can "Attack Ogre With Enchanted Weapon"
(drawing her sword and charging it up with fiery power to make a decisive final blow),
or "Avoid Ogre" (running from the bloodied ogre until it exhausts itself).
If the MC declares that a feature has come into play, like "Angry",
Tana could also "Attack Angry Ogre".

**To succeed at the Action, the activation cost of every Word in the action must be paid**.
If not every word is activated, the entire Action fails and the MC determines what happens.

**To pay activation costs, roll dice**.
You can take dice from any Pools you are allowed to use.
Resolve can be used in any Action.
Some rules or Words can allow you to use other Pools as well.
Roll the dice you take, then assign each die to a specific Word.
You can apply multiple dice to a single Word,
summing the totals shown on the dice.
You cannot apply the same die to multiple Words.

For example, Tana wants to "Attack Ogre".
The "Attack" Word has a cost of 4 &#9734;.
The Ogre is a rating 5 Challenge, so has a cost of 5.
Tana has 4 Resolve dice and 2 Courage dice.
Her "Attack" Word lets her use Courage, so she can roll dice from either pool.

She takes both Courage dice and rolls them, getting a 4 and a 6.
She assigns the 4 to Attack and the 6 to Ogre, fully paying the Action cost.

**Once the action is resolved, you get dice back**.
You can take back a number of dice equal to the total star ratings of all Words in your action.
You can't get more dice back than were rolled.
These dice can be placed back into any Pools you want.

For example, Tana's "Attack" word is one star.
She takes one of the two dice she rolled back, and places it back in her Courage Pool.

**The MC can always offer you one or more Twists**.
If you are unable or unwilling to pay dice from your Pools,
you can accept dice from a Twist Pool created by the MC.

Characters can cooperate as part of a single Action.
If several characters cooperate, they can all add Words to the Action,
and they can all contribute dice to activating those Words.
If you get dice back because some of the Words have star ratings,
the total dice returned are divided up by the players as they see fit.
No Word can be part of the same Action more than once -
for example, two characters cannot both add "Confront" to the table at the same time.

For example, Tana and Basler cooperate to attack a dangerous Dire Sloth.
The spunky swordswoman charges the beast with a loud war-cry,
and the sneaky thief stabs it from ambush while it's distracted!
Tana contributes "Attack" (4 &#9734;) and Basler contributes "Backstab" (4 &#9734;).
The Dire Sloth has an activation cost of 10 and must only be hit once.
The Action is "Attack and Backstab Dire Sloth".

Tana's Attack Word lets her roll Courage,
and Basler's Backstab Word lets him roll Stealth.
Tana rolls Courage dice and gets a 1 and a 4.
Basler rolls his 2 Stealth dice and gets 6 and 3.
This isn't quite enough, so Tana rolls a Resolve die and gets another 4.
They assign the dice thus: Attack (4), Backstab (4), Dire Sloth (6+3+1).
This is enough to overcome the Sloth.

There are two stars in play, one on Attack and one on Backstab.
The players each receive one die back.
Tana assigns hers back to her Resolve Pool,
while Basler takes one back for his Stealth Pool.

Challenges lose endurance per Action, not per character.
Thus, the Sloth would have lost one square, not two.

## Twists

Twists are **a tool for the MC to create tension and maintain the tone of the game**.
Twists can also be used to reward players for interesting or inventive tactics.

**Twist is a temporary Pool created by the MC**.
It will have between 1 and 5 dice.

**Twists come with a condition**.
If a player takes Twist dice as part of their action, the condition comes to pass.
The more dice in the Pool, the more serious or dramatic the condition should be.
Twists can represent critical hits, enemy reinforcements,
complications to an existing challenge, or many other things.
A Twist can change which features of a Challenge are active.

**Twist conditions don't have to be negative**.
The condition can also be the player agreeing to do something exciting
or interesting as part of their action,
and the Twist's dice are a reward for making the game more fun as a result.

**Twists are optional**.
Players are never forced to accept a Twist.
Players can suggest a Twist to the MC, but the MC is not required to accept.

**Multiple Twists can be in play**.
The MC might offer a one-die Twist with a minor condition,
as well as a four-dice Twist with a serious condition attached.
Players can accept both Twists, neither, or just one.

### Example Twists

Tana is fighting a dragon! The MC offers her a Twist:
"the beast takes to the air as you come into melee range -
but you can grab hold and be carried off".
If Tana's player accepts the extra dice for her attack, that is what happens.

Sir Emory is defending his friends from bandit arrows using his trusty shield.
The MC offers a twist: "you take an arrow in the leg,
hobbling your movement, but your friends are unharmed".

Basler is trying to help his friends escape, but he's spotted sneaking up on them.
In desperation, he says "I throw two knives at the ropes keeping them tied,
leaving me unarmed."
The MC agrees this is an interesting development, and offers Twist dice.

## Advancement

Characters become stronger by adventuring and exploring.
When a player's Thread reaches its last milestone,
they get to make a choice for their character:

* Gain a new Archetype
* Gain a single new Word, or a Word and associated Pool
* Trade one of your custom Words and/or Pools for another one
* Level Up a Pool or Word

Whatever the player chooses should flow logically out of the story they told,
and what happened to their character during that story.
For example, a Thread about a search for a missing book of magic
might let the character learn to become a magician.

Players who want to create a new Archetype should discuss it with the group
and make sure that it fits the tone of the game.
Archetypes should be _archetypical_ - that is,
you can imagine people other than your character being one,
and the concept fits well with the tone of the world.

If you gain a new Archetype that has Words or Pools you already have,
Level Up those Words or Pools instead of taking them a second time.

A player might want a new Word, like a new ability ("Befriend"),
a new item ("Crystal Sword"), or a new modifier ("Strategically")
that doesn't really fit into an Archetype.
In that case, it's appropriate to create something personal,
rather than try to build an Archetype around it that might seem too weird or too specialized.

For example, Sir Emory Hawthorne is trying to figure out his feelings
for his adventuring companion Tana.
His player creates a "For Tana" Word,
and an "Admiration" Pool that Recharges whenever the young knight
helps his friend achieve one of her goals.
He can use the "For Tana" Word in actions that protect or help her,
such as intercepting a goblin's cleaver or speaking in her defense at a trial.
And who knows? Perhaps some day Tana might add a "For Emory" Word to her own list...

## Discoveries

A Discovery is some unique encounter in the fiction - a place,
an artifact of power, a strange magical phenomenon, or even a living creature.
A Discovery is always special. It might feel different from its surroundings,
but it is never out of place. It's the reason for your journey.

A Discovery will do one or more of the following things:

* Drive a story forward by presenting a question or posing a challenge
* Decisively resolve elements of a story already in motion
* Evoke strong feelings, such as wonder, fear, or joy

Every Discovery should logically suggest a few **Challenges** that go with it.
For example, a group of characters might need to deal with a pack of sharks
to reach a sunken treasure ship,
then survive a fierce storm and a pirate attack getting the treasure back to port.

### Creating Discoveries

The results you get from this process aren't the final version of a Discovery.
They are the start of a conversation about what the group wants to add to their game world.
The random generation rules are meant to start a conversation, not shut one down.


You need to answer the first and most important question about a Discovery:
_What feeling should the characters have about this?_

Second: _What is the nature of the discovery?_

Third, and optionally: _What should the characters want to do about this discovery?_

| Roll | Feeling  | Nature             | Objective                             |
| :--- | :------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Joy      | Place (normal)     | Reach the discovery                   |
| 2    | Surprise | Place (exotic)     | Get away from the discovery           |
| 3    | Anger    | Object (mundane)   | Search for something or someone       |
| 4    | Fear     | Object (exotic)    | Hide, elude, or conceal something     |
| 5    | Disgust  | Person or Creature | Strengthen, improve, or fix something |
| 6    | Sorrow   | Event              | Weaken, break, or sabotage something  |

You can answer these questions yourself, or roll 1d6 per question and look at the table.

A randomly rolled Discovery may sound interesting,
but not be suitable for the current adventure.
In that case, the MC can file it away for later use, or a player can use it as part of their own Thread down the road.

There's a fourth question that only you can answer: _Now how do I do this?_
How do you stimulate the feeling you want to convey?

You evoke an emotion by drawing associations through language: color choices, words, and situations.

**Colors**:
Red (bravery, strength, aggression, anger).
Orange (safety, fun, passion, frustration).
Yellow (emotionality, friendliness, fear, depression).
Green (harmony, peace, stagnation, blandness).
Blue (serenity, order, aloofness, coldness).
Violet (spirituality, truth, decadence, repression).
Pink (nurturing, warmth, inhibition, vulnerability).
Brown (naturalness, reliability, humorless, simple).
Black (solidity, reassurance, menace, heaviness).
White (purity, simplicity, sterility, exclusiveness).

Once you have a color that corresponds to the emotion,
think about the sorts of things you associate with that color.
Forests are green, water is blue, caves are black, ice is white.
A peasant village can be earthy browns and greens,
while a martial fortress can be red-painted brick blazing in the sun.
A mysterious artifact can be violet, with flashes of other colors
from gemstones embedded into it.
A peaceful creature sent on a rampage might have red blood
smearing its green scales, showing the dominance of anger over peace.

You can take elements of the game already in play (places, NPCs, and so on),
and ask "what could happen to these things that would provoke this emotion?"
For example, a foreign military power capturing peaceful villagers
would probably evoke anger in your player characters,
so the slave camp where they are being kept would be an Anger-based discovery.

### Creating Challenges for Discoveries

A simple approach is to make three Challenges.

1. The first one will **embody or provoke the emotion** you want the Discovery to suggest
2. The second one will **escalate the action or the drama** inherent in the Discovery
3. The third one will **provide a climax and a feeling of closure** for interacting with the Discovery

For example, a Discovery might be a military slave camp where peaceful villagers
are being held captive.
The dominant emotion of this Discovery is anger.

The first Challenge for the PCs is a group of guards, away from the camp,
who are brutally whipping or beating an adult villager.
The PCs must intervene, both to defeat the guards
and to prevent any from escaping to raise the alarm.

The second Challenge might involve more guards (if one escaped),
a rescue attempt to recover more villagers (from the camp, or perhaps somewhere nearby),
and so on.
The stakes are higher, but the players are hopefully now invested in the Discovery thanks to the first Challenge.

The third can be the recovery of some key villagers who can organize a resistance,
or even the PCs leading a direct attack on the commandant of the camp.

## Threads

At the start of the game, each player comes up with a short pitch for a story they want to tell.
Examples would be "the mistreatment of the orcs",
"the search for an ancient grimoire", or "elves vs. magitek".
The player need not know how this story will end.
That can be determined during game play.

When a player starts a new Thread, they get five **milestones**.
When the group reaches a Discovery or faces a new Challenge,
the player can spend a milestone to make it part of their thread.
This signals that the Discovery or Challenge is a part of their ongoing story,
and the MC and group should discuss how the story moves forward with that in mind.

For example, when the group discovers a Lost Primordial Cave,
the player might spend a milestone to include it in their thread.
The group decides that ancient secrets of spirit-worship are found here,
that could rekindle the orcs' racial religion and help them escape their unhappy existence.
The group might encounter an orc shaman at the Cave,
and assist that character in uncovering these secrets.

Once a player has used up their last milestone,
the thread should be brought to a satisfying conclusion.
If this has not happened, the group can continue the story until that happens.
Once every player's threads have been resolved,
everyone starts over by creating new threads.
The reason for this is to allow everyone's story to be told,
without a single player dominating the group.
It's also intended to ensure that stories come to an eventual resolution without dragging on indefinitely.

Multiple players can claim the same Discovery or Challenge for their threads.
The group should discuss how this overlap happens.
Players are encouraged to think about how their stories
can complement the stories of their fellow players.

## Optional Rules

If you want to add more detail around injuries and gear, you can use these optional rules.

### Conditions

Tana breaks her leg, and Sir Emory sets it as best he can with a quick prayer of healing.
But she'll be hobbling for awhile, which will make things more difficult...

How do we model that?
By creating Words that represent some kind of deleterious condition.
The MC gives Tana a "With a Broken Leg" Word with an activation cost of 5.
Every action she takes where the leg is a serious impediment must include that Word.

### Equipment

Many adventurers care about the equipment they're carrying around.
You can model this using a combination of Words and Pools.

For example, the MC might give the characters a "Health Potion" Pool.
They can drink a potion, using dice from the pool when resisting damage
or overcoming poison.
