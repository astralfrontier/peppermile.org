title: Fairy Soul
---

As of 1905 A.D., a handful of scholars know a wonderful and terrible secret:
almost every man, woman, and child alive has a sleeping fairy soul inside them.
Our souls are prisons for these exiles from Arcadia.
They kept quiescent by bending human magic power inward.
But they can awaken.

Only humans contain the primordial inner power of magic,
but only fairies are capable of shaping and wielding such power.
Then how did this imprisonment happen?
Perhaps the two races fought, due to jealousy, fear, or some specific _casus belli_.
Perhaps it’s an amicable arrangement,
and everyone alive has simply forgotten the reasons for it.
Perhaps it’s something else entirely,
something only the sleeping immortal creatures could reveal.

War is coming.
The Great Game has only recently ended,
and the British Empire sits like a hungry spider
at the center of a very fragile web.
Chimeric monsters, dark dabblers in the occult,
and enigmatic creatures stalk the streets of London.
Other wonders - and unspeakable dangers - have been reported throughout the Empire.
Those who would fight back against them have a power, but it is not their own.
Is it right to use this captive soul for your own ends?
And if you could find a way to free the fairy race,
would that be better for the world... or worse?
