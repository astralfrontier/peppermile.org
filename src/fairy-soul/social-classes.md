title: Fairy Soul - Social Classes
---

#### The Gentleman

You are a member of the upper crust of British society. You are seen as wealthy, influential, or at the very least refined. People look to you with respect, but there are expectations. You are of higher social station than the Citizen or the Worker.

Answer these questions:

1. What is your reputation in high society? Punctual, Conservative, Eccentric, etc.
2. How did your fairy soul awaken?

Select one of the following moves:

**When you act with quiet determination to solve someone else's problem**, take +1 ongoing for as long as anyone around you has the Dismayed condition.

**When a difficulty can be overcome with money or resources**, you can choose to expend some of your reserves of wealth to do so. The MC may declare some problems too expensive to solve this way, or state that you have run out of funds for the time being.

**When you speak well of someone to your highborn peers**, that person may clear the Distrusted or Discouraged condition.

**When you maintain a reputation as a rotter or cad**, you can ignore the effects of the Distrusted condition provided nobody's Intimacy with you is higher than +0.

You can make the following advancement move:

**When you are ousted from high society**, change your social class from Gentleman to Citizen or Worker.

#### The Citizen

You are one of the growing middle class, with some money of your own but no strong economic or political position. You partake of the best - and worst - traits of both the upper and lower classes. You are of lower social station than the Gentleman, and higher than the Worker.

Answer these questions:

1. How did you achieve your current status? Inheritance, Hard Work, Luck, Crime, etc.
2. How did your fairy soul awaken?

Select one of the following moves:

**When you face a hopeless situation with cheer and good humor**, you may roll +Heart instead of +Action.

**When you survive through shrewdness and calculation**, you may roll +Mind instead of +Reserve.

**When you exhibit amusing eccentricities**, take the Distracted condition to clear the Dismayed or Discouraged conditions from everyone else around you.

**When you ask an innocent but illuminating question about a problem stumping someone else**, they may either clear the Distracted condition or take +1 forward to solve that problem.

You can make the following advancement moves:

**When you achieve wealth or influence enough to be recognized by high society**, change your social class to Gentleman.

**When you lose everything you worked so hard for**, change your social class from Citizen to Worker.

#### The Worker

You are one of the lower classes, the "common folk" or a servant. You're accustomed to manual labor, poverty, and hardship. Higher-class folk mostly overlook you, sometimes to their detriment. You are of lower social station than the Gentleman and the Citizen.

Answer these questions:

1. How do you earn your daily bread? Laborer, Servant, Beggar, Criminal, etc.
2. How did your fairy soul awaken?

Select one of the following moves:

**When you tell a hard truth to people above your station**, you suffer no social consequences or dice penalties as long as what you said comes from the heart, and is said in a respectful and subservient manner.

**When you insinuate yourself into a high-class person's circle of servants or staff**, roll +Heart. On a hit, ask one question about their activities and receive a true answer, as long as you are willing to give up some information of your own. On 10+, ask up to three questions, giving up one thing per question.

**When you play the part of the lower-class villain**, your actions will not draw official scrutiny or close examination as long as you have the Distrusted condition.

**When you stand in solidarity with your working-class fellows**, you can rebuff investigation or influence by someone of a higher social class, so long as the law isn't involved.

You can make the following advancement move:

**When you achieve some measure of respectability and income**, change your social class from Worker to Citizen.

#### The Foreigner

You are not Anglo-Saxon. You might be a citizen of the Empire, or an outsider, or even an American. Standing outside of the traditional British social structure excludes you from many opportunities, but also shields you from many expectations and retributions.

Answer these questions:

1. Where are you from? Your country, your religious beliefs, and so on.
3. How did your fairy soul awaken?

Select one of the following moves:

**When you present yourself as an inscrutable outsider to British citizens**, you can resist questioning or casual examination if you gain the Distrusted condition for the duration of your social contact.

**When your education or intellect would be underestimated due to your background**, you may make one declaration of fact about the current situation that would be inconvenient, embarrassing, or humiliating for the individual in question.

**When you act as the personal assistant or paid servant of a British citizen**, you may roll +Reserve instead of +Intimacy to assist your or his or her associates.

You can make the following advancement move:

**If you somehow gain acceptance from British society**, change your social class from Foreigner to Citizen.

If you ever occupied this social class, you may return to it as a special advancement move.
