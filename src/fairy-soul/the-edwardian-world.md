#### The Arcadia Club

A social club instituted to protect and unite those with an awakened fairy soul. The club has taken the unheard-of step in permitting women and foreigners to be members. Membership is contingent on your access to power, not on your body or nationality.

Visitors to the club must demonstrate some of their power to masked guards in private, then are given masks and robes and admitted into the club's common rooms. Anonymity in the common rooms is the rule. Members may communicate with pre-printed cards (as even an accent or manner of speaking may betray one's identity) and can arrange time in private rooms. Members may - but are not required to - unmask once in private.

The club can serve as a patron for player characters, or a rival
to a player-created organization.
