#### Attributes

Characters have two pairs of attributes: Mind/Heart and Reserve/Action. The rules for paired attributes are that no attribute can be raised above 2 or lowered below -1, and the sum of an attribute pair must be exactly 1.

Think of paired stats on a continuum - while one goes from -1 to +0 to +1 to +2, the other goes from +2 to +1 to +0 to -1.

#### Intimacy

Your willingness to share your inner thoughts and true feelings with another person is measured by your Intimacy to them. Low Intimacy represents an emotional barrier, while high Intimacy represents characters who trust each other and feel safe sharing their secrets. Low intimacy also doesn't require conflict or negative emotions. A character who respects and admires a friendly superior from a distance can have low Intimacy, because he doesn't feel comfortable opening up to the object of his admiration.

Pick one member of the group that you are especially comfortable with or close to, and record +1 Intimacy with that person. Pick another member that you are in conflict with or distant from, and record -1 Intimacy with them. You have +0 Intimacy with every other player character.

Intimacy cannot go below -1 or above +2. Intimacy does not have to be the same between two characters. One character can feel they can trust another without that feeling being reciprocated.

"Intimacy" does not imply anything sexual or romantic. If the entire group is comfortable exploring this topic, you should do so in another fashion.

#### Conditions

Characters can experience one or more of the following conditions, which are gained or removed in play.

**Distracted**. You have something occupying your thoughts - a logical problem, a difficult dilemma, or the Gordian knot of a complex unexpressed emotion. Take -1 ongoing when you roll +Mind until this condition is cleared. You can clear this condition by having someone else resolve the problem for you, or by being forced to abandon it entirely.

**Distrusted**. You have done something base, scandalous, or notorious that causes people to talk in hushed whispers about you. Take -1 ongoing when you roll +Heart until this condition is cleared. You can clear this condition by acting in an especially meritorious fashion or redeeming your earlier misstep in some notable way.

**Dismayed**. Your composure and strength of will have been shaken by something startling, shocking, or unsettling. Take -1 ongoing when you roll +Reserve until this condition is cleared. You can clear this condition by someone else showing strength in the face of danger, or by being surrounded by the familiar and routine.

**Discouraged**. You've lost faith in yourself or your allies, and feel that nothing can be done to get out of present circumstances. Take -1 ongoing when you roll +Action until this condition is cleared. You can clear this condition by seeing someone else succeed at something thought hopeless, or by having your hopes and ambitions directly threatened.

**Injured**. You are physically hurt somehow. Take -1 ongoing to physical actions. Some actions may not be physically possible, or may worsen your condition. You can clear this condition with appropriate medical care and bed rest, or through magical healing.

**Unbalanced**. You are having trouble accessing or controlling your magic for some reason. Take -1 ongoing to magical actions. Some manifestation moves may not be possible, or worsen your condition. You can clear this condition by resolving the conflict with your fairy soul or retraining yourself to work with its magic.
