title: Fairy Soul - Basic Moves
---

You can use any of these moves as appropriate, regardless of your playbook choices.

**When you are confronted by difficulty...**  
**...and you resolve it through consideration and observation, roll +Mind.**  
**...dealing with matters of the heart, needing understanding or influence, roll +Heart.**  
**...and you stand firm and unshaken, roll +Reserve.**  
**...and you take steps to change the situation, roll +Action.**  
On 10+, you achieve a solution or important insight. On 7-9, you do so at a cost or with a condition.

**When you roll dice and get a miss**, gain 1 Awakening.

**When you reach 5 Awakening**, reset your Awakening to 0 and make an advancement move.

#### Magical Moves

You can use any of these moves if you have chosen a manifestation.

**When you close your eyes and meditate at the shores of the Arcadian Ocean**, you can communicate mentally with anyone else doing the same thing, and who is willing to speak with you. You can exchange words, pictures, or memories.

#### Intimacy Moves

**When someone's actions challenge your notion of who they are**, gain or lose 1 Intimacy with them, depending on whether the revelation is favorable or unfavorable in your eyes (your decision).

**When you see someone else express a shocking, beautiful, or secret part of themselves**, and your Intimacy with them is either +2 or -1, reset Intimacy with them to 0 and gain 1 Awakening.

**When you assist someone in a way that calls for trust or cooperation**, roll +Intimacy. On any hit, your aid is successful and useful in some way, but you are now involved in the situation and may share in any costs or consequences paid by your ally. On 10+, your ally takes +1 forward on their task. On a miss, you get in the way or otherwise hamper their efforts.

#### Advancement Moves

You can only make advancement moves when explicitly told to do so. You can find additional advancement moves on some social classes and manifestations.

**Gain one new move from your manifestation**. Your control over your magic, or your relationship with your fairy soul, has improved.

**Gain one new move from your social class**. You're more settled into your ways and more comfortable with who you are.

**Change one of your attribute pairs**. You can assign a new value to one set of paired attributes, such as moving a +2/-1 pair to +1/+0, exchanging which attribute is higher, and so forth.
