#### MC moves

When you are called on to say do something in game,
often in response to a character's actions,
pick one of the following moves, or devise your own.

* Put someone in a high-stakes situation.
* Give them a difficult decision to make.
* Announce off-screen badness.
* Announce future badness.
* Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
* Make a move from one of your Nightmares.
* Deal harm. This can be a description of actual injuries or wounds, a condition, or something else.
* Trade harm for harm.
* Make the power of magic feel mysterious and willful.
* Reward hard choices concerning honor and freedom.
* Provide a glimpse of true beauty and wonder.

#### Hard moves

A hard move isn't substantially different from other MC moves.
What's different is the impact on the status quo.

For example, Sir Reginald, Eddie, and Amir are investigating cabalist
activity in London.
During the investigation, the MC determines that Amir should hear word of a
cult from his home land.
This is the "announce off-screen badness" move.
It doesn't substantially derail Amir's activities,
but does set up some plot for him to pursue later.

Later, Eddie's player rolls a 5 while trying to sneak into a gentleman's club.
The MC makes another move, by telling Eddie he hears the screams of his
beloved sister in the distance. This is another variant of announcing badness,
but now the stakes are higher and more immediate: something is very wrong
with Eddie's family. But it also means that something has irrevocably changed.
The cult has access to Eddie's family.

#### Nightmares
War, poverty, and want are part of the world. But sometimes, dreams turn dark and power is turned to evil purposes.

The MC can define **nightmares**, which are existential threats to the world in both the physical and spiritual realm.
Nightmares come with **dark portents**, signaling that the nightmare is growing closer, stronger, or both.

Nightmares may also have their own moves.
