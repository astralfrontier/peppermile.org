#### Moves
Moves are game mechanics triggered by fiction and that result in new fiction. Moves have a trigger - "when this happens" - and an outcome - "then do this". Many moves call for a dice roll, and have other mechanical effects.

Moves are **mandatory**. If a move is triggered by something happening in the fiction, you cannot say that thing without triggering that move.

Moves are **fiction-first**. You cannot say "I'm going to use my Special Powers Move". Instead, tell the group what your character does, and any moves that it incurs are then triggered.

Players and the MC should listen for move triggers and bring them to the attention of the group.

#### Rolling

When you are called on to use dice (e.g. "roll +Heart"), roll 2d6 and add the value of the indicated attribute.

A result of 2 to 6 is a "miss". A result of 7 to 12 is a "hit". Many rules are more specific about what happens when you roll 7 through 9 ("7-9"), or roll 10 or above ("10+").

When you miss, the MC makes a hard move against you. See "MC Moves" later on for suggestions.

#### Taking +1

Many rules will say "take +1 forward" or "take +1 ongoing". In both cases, this means adding +1 to whatever you roll. For example, if you roll 2d6 and get a 6, but you can take +1 forward, you effectively got a 7 and got a hit instead of a miss.

Taking +1 forward means that you can apply that +1 to the next roll that satisfies the stated conditions. For example, "take +1 forward to assist a friend" means you can only get the +1 on a roll that does that thing. If you make other rolls in the meantime, the bonus doesn't apply but it doesn't go away either. It just sits there, waiting to be used.

Taking +1 ongoing means you can apply that +1 to every roll until some condition is satisfied, at which point the bonus goes away. For example, "take +1 ongoing to defeat the monster" means every roll you make is augmented until the monster is defeated.

#### Hold

Some rules will give you "hold". This is some number of points that you receive as part of the rule, and spend in ways that the rule provides for. If you make another move that wasn't triggered by spending hold, the hold goes away.
