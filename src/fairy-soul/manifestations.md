title: Fairy Soul - Manifestations
---

#### The Hero

The fairy that slept in your soul is gone - taken out, or destroyed. The natural wellspring of magical power that all humans share gushes forth to fill the void, making you stronger, faster, and smarter than your mundane peers. But the fairy's absence means the death of your own dreams. Denied the glimpse of Arcadia and the touch of the sublime that the common man takes for granted, you do great deeds and champion worthy causes, hoping for just a moment to feel truly happy again.

Take the following move:

**When you struggle to defend another's dreams**, your physical and mental powers grow beyond your normal limits and you may attempt things impossible to mundane people.

In addition, select one of the following moves:

**When you commit your amazing intellect to a problem**, you are guaranteed to think up a solution eventually, but you must forego food, sleep, comfort, and company in pursuit of your goal.

**When things are desperate and everyone looks to you**, your allies can gain 1 Intimacy with you if they follow your orders and assist you, whether or not the assistance is successful.

**When you forsake human frailty to become an icon of strength**, take +1 ongoing to deal with a crisis for as long as you show a callous disregard for the feelings of your comrades.

**When you take decisive action against impossible odds**, name one goal and one sacrifice. If the MC accepts and you make the sacrifice, you will achieve the goal.

You can make the following advancement moves:

**Seal an unfettered fairy inside your soul**, and choose a new manifestation. Gain the Unbalanced condition until you have time to adjust to the new reality.

**Approach apotheosis**. Choose one condition; you no longer suffer dice penalties from it, though the MC may rule the condition hampers you in other ways.

#### The Galvanist

The fairy that sleeps in your soul dreams of power - of earth and wind, of rain and flame, of darkness and lightning. You draw these dreams into energetic eruptions of power in the real world. While you can work wonders with the elements of natural philosophy and the new sciences of electricity and chemistry, sometimes your fairy's dreams turn to nightmares.

Take the following move:

**When you feel something deeply or intently**, these feelings bubble forth into an elemental eruption which you can shape to a limited extent. This effect will act on your strong feelings and driving goals, but can also betray those feelings to anyone who sees it.

In addition, select one of the following moves:

**When you direct your elemental powers with precision**, roll +Mind. On 10+, the eruption of power is the right one for the job at hand. On 7-9, the MC suggests a twist or unintended side effects. If you accept, the eruption occurs as agreed. On a miss, a wholly inappropriate or surprising effect occurs.

**When you evoke nature's beauty, grace, and elegance**, roll +Heart. On 10+, you create an elemental eruption that awes, stuns, or impresses onlookers. On 7-9, the eruption is mixed with some secret impulse or urge you feel. On a miss, the dark and terrible truths of nature answer your call instead.

**When you draw out a shield of elemental power**, roll +Reserve. On a hit, you or someone or something else is surrounded and protected by a stationary elemental effect such as fire, rain, etc. On 10+, you can move or shape the shield as you wish.

**When you quicken your body or spirit with your elemental might**, roll +Action. On a hit, you become an avatar of your element and may act according to this new nature. On 7-9, the power threatens to overwhelm your instincts and humanity, and you must obey some of its demands.

You may make the following advancement moves:

**Change your relationship with your fairy soul**, and choose a new manifestation. Gain the Unbalanced condition until you have time to adjust to the new reality.

**Gain a permanent elemental effect** that you can call up at will.

#### The Mesmerist

Your fairy whispers to the hearts and minds of others. Through illusion, animal magnetism, and the mastery of invisible forces, you can heal, create cunning phantasms or bewitchments, or even enter dreams. The inhuman whispers of a fairy, though, do not always produce the effects you desire.

Take the following move:

**When you walk through the land of dreams**, ask the MC for the answer to one question. The MC will answer in riddles and half-truths, but there must always be a spark of truth or a meaningful statement amidst the dross.

In addition, select one of the following moves:

**When you beguile or bewitch another**, roll +Mind. On 10+, you can state one true thing and make it seem false, or say one falsehood and make it true, until the subject is convinced of the contrary through experience or persuasion. On 7-9, you may do the same if you give up one of your own beliefs for the same amount of time.

**When you peer into the heart of another**, roll +Heart. On a hit, you may ask one question and have it answered in a manner the target believes true. On 7-9, what you learn displaces some part of your own mind and beliefs temporarily. On a miss, the target answers but may lie to you.

**When you strengthen or repair the heart of another**, roll +Reserve. On a hit, you can exchange one condition for another, or clear a condition if the subject voluntarily shares a hidden part of their heart with you. On 10+, you can clear the condition instead. On a miss, the subject gains a new condition instead as a reaction to your meddling.

**When you compel another through mesmeric influence**, roll +Action. On a hit, you can command them to perform some action that's neutral or positive for them. On 10+, you can command an action that would inconvenience or harm them.

You may make the following advancement moves:

**Change your relationship with your fairy soul**, and choose a new manifestation. Gain the Unbalanced condition until you have time to adjust to the new reality.

**Gain a contagious beguilement**. When you beguile or bewitch another successfully, your target has a chance (determined by the MC) of spreading the glamour to others by speaking to them.

#### The Zoanthrope

Your fairy is drawn partially into the physical world, merging with and changing your physical body. You can become animals, monsters, or weird hybrid creatures. You are a powerful combatant and cunning hunter, provided your new instincts do not overwhelm your human reason.

Take the following move:

**When you adopt the form of a natural animal or plant**, gain your new form's abilities, nature, instincts, and moves in addition to your own. You are restricted by your new form's physical potentials and may fall prey to your new urges.

In addition, select one of the following moves:

**When you submerge your intellect into animal instinct**, roll +Mind. On a hit, you can ignore civilized rules and moral limits and gain a predator's superior awareness. On 10+, take +1 forward to act on these instincts, as long as you retain your feral mental state. On a miss, the animal mind takes over and leads you into grim and bloody business.

**When you attune to the magic of nature**, roll +Heart and ask one question about the physical environment. On a hit, you get as good an answer as the local flora or fauna could give. On 10+, you may ask three questions.

**When you must calm or control any creature with an animal's mind**, roll +Reserve. On a hit, the creature becomes docile and cooperative. On 10+, the creature falls under your command.

**When you take the form of a half-human hybrid**, roll +Action. On 10+, you may overwhelm a mortal foe (or small group of them) in any two activities: defeating your foe in open combat, terrifying your foe, pursuing your foe, evading your foe, or stalking your foe unseen. On 7-9, you may do so for a single activity, or for two if you indulge in your bestial instincts and animal drives at least part of the time.

You may make the following advancement moves:

**Change your relationship with your fairy soul**, and choose a new manifestation. Gain the Unbalanced condition until you have time to adjust to the new reality.

**Gain a small animal companion**, that will follow you loyally and with whom you can mentally and verbally communicate.

#### The Evoker

Your fairy can be brought into the world as a partially independent entity. Your fairy is at least somewhat awake, and acts more as a partner than a tool for doing magic. But at the same time, it can be willful or independent.

Take the following move:

**When you conjure up your fairy soul and imbue it with magic**, it appears in the physical world as a tangible entity until dismissed or dissolved. Your fairy cannot be killed; if its body is destroyed, it returns to your soul to sleep. It is intelligent, but inhuman and naive in the ways of your world.

In addition, select one of the following moves:

**When you ask something non-trivial or difficult of your fairy**, roll +Mind. On a hit, the creature comprehends your will and can execute a complex task on your behalf. On 10+, the fairy can communicate clearly with you, letting you make adjustments to the task as it progresses. On a miss, the fairy misunderstands your wishes in a comical or disastrous fashion.

**When you shape your fairy into another form**, roll +Heart. On a hit, your fairy glamours itself to look, sound, smell, and feel like whatever or whoever you envision. On 10+, people who interact with the glamour are bewitched into remembering conversations or interactions suitable to the thing or person the fairy has mimicked.

**When you imbue your fairy with resilience**, roll +Reserve. On a hit, your fairy will stand in defense of you and that which you hold dear. Hold 1. On 10+, hold 3. Spend 1 hold to negate harm to yourself or your allies, allowing the fairy to deal with the attack instead.

**When you empower your fairy with strength**, roll +Action. On a hit, your fairy grows to heroic proportions and becomes a fearful, powerful combatant. Hold 1. On 10+, hold 3. Spend 1 hold to direct your fairy to destroy one man-size object or defeat a typical opponent, or damage a larger object or more capable foe.

You may make the following advancement moves:

**Change your relationship with your fairy soul**, and choose a new manifestation. Gain the Unbalanced condition until you have time to adjust to the new reality.

**Imbue your fairy with some of your intellect**. Thereafter, you can communicate telepathically with your fairy, see through its eyes, and share memories and thoughts with it.
