### The Rasende Hammer

The Rasende Hammer is a bloodline relic of a far-off kingdom.
At its heart is a bound Dragon of Rage, writhing in endless torment.
The hammer was built as a weapon of war.
It could absorb the anger of its wielder and anybody that pledged their loyalty
to them, and turn that collective rage into magical might.
The king or queen of a kingdom could face an invading army on equal terms.

The Hammer should evoke _anger_.
Even getting near it will bring one's passions bubbling and boiling to the surface.
Actually grasping it will place the wielder into a berserker rage.
The only people who can safely wield it are the heirs of its former kingdom.
Aside from the power of the hammer itself, many people have committed many wrongs,
both in its name and to keep it sealed away.

It is an actual warhammer, oversized as though built for a tall and muscular warrior.
The haft is wrapped in thick leather from an unknown animal.
The entire hammer is rust-red and seemingly coated with dried blood,
but it remains intact and frighteningly effective if wielded.
Affixed to the pommel is a blood-red ruby which holds the Dragon spirit.
The ruby cannot be removed or harmed except by powerful magic.

The hammer was captured by a cabal of wizards some time ago.
Potent spells were woven around it to lull the dragon and suppress the hammer's power.
The wizards flung it into a valley and laid a curse upon the whole region.
The valley was encased in ice and eternal winter.
The cold served two purposes: to cool the burning rage of the hammer,
and to deter anybody who wanted to wield the hammer themselves.
As long as the cold reigns, the Dragon sleeps.
But if somebody removed the weapon from its frosty cradle, it would wake...

The PCs might come across the frozen valley while traveling.
They might be in search of the rightful heir who can wield the hammer
for a just and righteous cause.
Or they might wish to end the curse of the Rasende Hammer - one way or another.
