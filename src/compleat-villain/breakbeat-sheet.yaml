power:
  name: Sonic Manipulation
  description: Breakbeat manifests an internal rhythm to create a variety of sonic effects, amplifying his martial arts or blasting enemies.
  powers:
    - Energy Blast (fire a projectile up to three zones away with Agility)
    - Super Agility (+2 to Agility when leaping, balancing, or demonstrating agility)
    - Uncanny Dodge (+2 to Agility defend against ranged attacks)
    - Super Speed (+2 to Agility when moving quickly, run across liquids or up sheer surfaces)
  effects:
    - Forced Movement (knock people around with focused sound energy)
    - Area Attack (unleash a sonic blast over an area)
  drawback: Breakbeat's powers have a <b>Predictable Rhythm</b>.
  collateral: If you take a few seconds to concentrate, you can generate a blast with enough force to blow open the door to a bank vault, destroy a reinforced wall, or otherwise eradicate an obstacle. Of course, a blast this big is slow and imprecise. Itâ€™ll tear up the entire room.
