# Breakbeat

This is Gabriel Ramon, aka "Breakbeat", a DJ and supervillain more or less in that order of proficiency.
The boy's not bad, but I'm trying to talk him out of the business anyway, 'cause he won't listen when I give him good advice.
He'd be better off waxing tracks than capping capes.

This kid is the son of an immigrant mother and a big-name street musician.
Just between us, the old man was outta the big leagues,
and his career got cut a little short after a disagreement with an important record producer
who had as much gun as the senior Ramon had mouth.

So Gabriel grows up with his sainted mother, who every day is telling him, "don't be like your father".
And every day the street is telling him, "you gotta be a man and avenge yourself".
He's intelligent and ambitious, though.
He puts on shows at night, focuses on his studies during the day.
He goes and learns Capoeira, thinking there's gonna be some kind of showdown,
some crazy Last Dragon shit where he starts glowing and the bad guy gets his comeuppance.
Nope. Homeboy wound up in ICU.

Turns out that's what jump-started his powers.
He heals up, comes back looking for a rematch, and catches his father's killer off guard.
This time the bloodbath goes the other way.
Broken bones, internal organs pulped by powerful sonic blasts.
Scratch one producer, a slew of bodyguards, and an up-and-coming rapper who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
But Gabriel got his revenge on, and that's all that matters, right?

So now there's this new guy on the streets who's ready to shake down every pimp,
dealer, shady music executive, and other unsavory sort that ever did his friends and family dirty.
The cops get called, then the capes, and before you know it he's a full-blown supervillain.
He thinks of himself as Robin Hood, when all he's doing is robbin' the hood.

He's in love with his powers, but they're his biggest weakness.
See, he's all sonic.
He's got this internal rhythm or sound-machine going in his head.
If he turns up the volume on it, his abilities power up.
But he's locked into that rhythm - if he changes it up, his powers shut off for several seconds, and he's vulnerable.
He has to move according to that rhythm, so he's predictable to detectives or martial artists who can
read body language and sync up with it themselves.
And if that internal volume gets too loud, he sorta goes crazy, and everything just starts exploding.
If you ever really hear that rhythm yourself, run your ass off, because shit is about to get very loud and very bad.

Breakbeat has a rich sepia skin and nice bone structure.
He's tall, and used to be skinny until he started hitting the gym.
He used to wear his hair in his dad's style - thick cornrows - but finally shaved it ultra-short,
probably because that's easier to wash blood out of.
He wears a padded sparring suit from a martial arts dojo, with some reinforced armor plates in pockets.
Mostly he uses his powers to protect himself, but safety first.
It's colored in this outlandish psychedelic pattern that he swears is from Goa and I insist is from Woodstock, but whatever.
