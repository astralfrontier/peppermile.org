title: Super-Sheriffs of Sagan City
---

In 1967, the superhero Apollo was the first man to walk on the moon.

Three years ago, Apollo discovered an alien portal orbiting Jupiter.
Beyond it was another star system, and a new Earth.
Scientists dubbed it 'Gaia'.

A year ago, the first human colony outside the solar system was founded.
Named 'Sagan City', it was to study every puzzle that Gaia presented,
starting with the biggest one:
Living things on the planet had superpowers, just like the handful
of heroes and villains of Earth. But _everything_ had them.
Could Gaia explain where superpowers come from?

As they probe the planet's mysteries, Sagan City's researchers face many challenges:
the friendly but confusing 'Morphs' of the nearby alien enclave Sunrise,
the supervillain anarchist commune of Bester's Gulch,
the enigmatic assemblage of extraterrestrials at Node 3373,
the mysterious and relentless Harvesters,
and the super-powered beasts and monsters of Gaia itself.

_You_ are the sheriffs of this super-colony, just come from Earth.
You must keep the peace, protect the people, keep the colony running,
and perhaps unlock the secrets Gaia has to offer.
