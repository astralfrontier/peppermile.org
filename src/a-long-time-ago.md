title: A Long Time Ago
---

**A Long Time Ago** is a two-page game for playing Star Wars.
It's stripped down to the barest essentials:
characters, actions, rolls.

The game doesn't use a Pass-Fail success system.
Instead, players roll to establish the *Balance*
of their action: how close to the Light or Dark they get.
Sometimes you want to roll high (aid a buddy),
while other deeds favor the low end (blow up a TIE Fighter).
Characters are built to favor Light or Dark results
depending on the actions they take.
